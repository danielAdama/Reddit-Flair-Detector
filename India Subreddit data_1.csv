# Youtube accounts:

# Channel number 1,  named 'WhiteHat Sr'.

# 7 vides were removed from this channel.

* The only video which has been reinstated till now is of a balloon with WhiteHatJr and Byjus written on it, titled 'Difference between WhiteHatSr and Byjus'. In no way there were any copyright infringements in this video. You can find the video on my youtube channel or twitter (@WhiteHatSnr). So now Aiplex or Byjus won't apologize for removing the video? Just like that, they can remove anyone's videos?
* For the rest of the video, youtube rejected my appeal stating ' *Thank you for your counter-notification. Unfortunately, it's unclear to us whether you have a valid reason for filing a counter-notification, so we won't be able to honor your request.*  One of the videos which was removed was a screen recording of my phone, where I click on Google Play, open whiteharJr app, and check its reviews, the third and fourth videos were exactly the same, word to word. That's the video, hardly 30 seconds, no background music or commentary. Yet it was removed for 'CopyRight Infringements'.

# Channel number 2, named 'Safed Topi Sr 2'.

# 7  videos were removed from here.

* Videos were removed for reasons such as 'WhiteHatJr logo is shown on top left corner of the screen'. So I uploaded the same video with its entire screen blurred. And that video was also removed by WhiteHatJr for copyright Infringements.
* In one video I show every 5-star fake review of WhiteHatJr app on GooglePlay Store. This video getting banned seems so strange because I am showing fake reviews on Google Play Store which Google itself should not allow in the first place, and then their own Sibling company Youtube removes video. And then also rejects all my counter-notification stating I don't have any valid reason.
* Wolf Gupta video: This kid does not exist. And WhiteHatJr keeps changing his age from 9-14 years old and his salary from 1.2 crore rupees to 20 crores and then 150 crores. And this Wolf Gupta supposedly works in Google. So when I make a video on this, instead of taking any actions against WhiteHatJr, Google (YouTube) removes my video. Now Byjus higher mgmt says if Google/Barak Obama/Blue Origin/Elon Musk/Bill gates etc doesn't have any issue in whitehatjr using their pics, who am I to say anything. Well, its the public who is getting fooled with false advertisements, Elon Musk doesn't have time to look into WhiteHatJr ads!
* Videos on this channel got removed with in 30-45 minutes of getting uploaded. The entire channel was banned permanently so fast that I didnt even get time to file appeal for some of the videos.

# Channel number 3, named 'Pradeep Poonia 3.0'.

# Three videos have been removed from here till now.

* Some people suggested that my videos were getting removed because I used WhiteHat name. So I left that name after the second channel itself. And used my own name in this third channel. Here also videos are getting removed. One more strike, this channel would also be gone.
* The 'CLOUD' video is also removed. Hope you guys will make sure that that Cloud video always stays up in 'Cloud'.

# Two Reddit accounts

# 

1. u/whiteHatSr : permanently suspended for 'Harassment'. Ironically the post from this account was 'Byjus is Harassing me. Please help')
2. u/WhiteHat_Sr : here the post was 'My first Reddit account got suspended'.

&#x200B;

# Quora account

was temp suspended for 14 days for commenting a couple of answers. The account has no whiteHat anything in it, it was many years old personal account.

&#x200B;

# First Twitter account

@ WhiteHatSr was suspended suspiciously. Then I made an account @ WhiteHatSnr.

&#x200B;

\-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

I think a total of 16 videos have been removed by now. I have tagged Youtube India on twitter asking explanations. They are ignoring all my tweets. Please support those threads on twitter (@ WhiteHatSNR)

After these videos of many other YouTubers are also taken down like its nothing.

Byjus is totally controlling the internet, especially Quora, Youtube, and where we are right now. I had been trying to post this for a week.

\-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

What's next?

Some good things are happening behind the scene. Those will be revealed soon. Also, I will keep on uploading the videos on youtube on new channels. Support from you people would really help the cause.

\-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

&#x200B;

You can find most of the deleted videos on Telegram at WhiteHatPoonia

And on LBRY. Link is in bio of my twitter handle.

Thanks

Update (21.10.2020). Recently they removed a LinkedIn article also from my LinedIn profile.","Again, you are saying BYJU'S/WhitehatJr is a scam and you have the evidence and YouTube, Quora, Twitter etc. is 'unfairly' removing the content because BYJU's, a company valued at a measly $10Bn in comparison to these companies is 'controlling the internet'. Maybe your videos are getting removed because they are violating the terms and conditions clearly mentioned in those websites and hence you have no legal ground.

From your earlier posts, you claim to have evidence/proof that these companies are 'scamming' people. I urge you to take legal action against them then. But I'm sure you will never do that since all your proof/evidence does not hold ground. If you did, I'd be the first one to support you.

Lastly, what you're highlighting in your posts are bad business practices employed by BYJU'S/WhitehatJr. But there is a significant difference between a bad/unethical business practice versus a 'scam'. Value is subjective, and parents who buy these courses for their kids may/may not find value in it. If their product is inferior/does not serve a 'need' in marketing language, then the market itself will drive them out. They are never 'forcing' these parents to buy their courses. If you can prove that, then I do agree they are involved in extortion. 

But I'm sure you're aware of all of these facts told to you here by multiple redditors and are still going this route because you have no legal ground. But my fellow redditors, please read between the lines and see the intent behind this person's posts. He is in no way a 'good samaritan' claiming to take down an 'evil corporation'. For all we know he could be employed by one of their competitors to run smear campaigns such as these. So make your own judgement while supporting this guy and his 'proofs'.

PS: Let the downvoting begin. ",2020-10-04 21:13:33

**[NEW ANNOUNCEMENT FOR THE FIFTH GIVEAWAY HERE!](https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/cb05ss/hello_i_am_giving_away_free_copies_of_brave_new/)**

---

**NEWS!** Whoa! Something just happened! [Both our Giveaways of '1984' and 'Animal Farm' made those book's arrival to the Amazon's 'Most Wished For' list!](https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/a32t7h/rindia_giveaways_bring_1984_and_animal_farm_to/) This is Pretty huge! I mean I've seen 1984 on that list before, in 2014 and in 2016, the years of huge political catastrophes; but I've never seen Animal Farm on that list. Congratulation guys, you all did it! We are going to make another book come on that list very soon! Third Giveaway is on its way! 🎁

**UPDATE:** Wow! I guess I ordered so many copies, that [this particular edition ran out of stock!](https://i.imgur.com/f5AIacO.jpg) 😄 Not an issue though, I am ordering other editions that are available.

**MONEY UPDATE:** [This is how the order page looks](https://i.imgur.com/vazq7Hn.jpg) 😅  I used my second Amazon account just for this Giveaway. Each book cost me anywhere between Rs.60 to Rs.120. But for 80% of the orders, I picked the one which is Rs.60, so you can take an average of Rs.80/Book. Some sellers have an order limit, so I pick an edition, and start with each seller one by one, until they give up, then I select another seller, and then another edition. 😊

* 📖 Giveaway [Part 2]

I launched a [book giveaway a few days ago here](https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/9z3lxo/hello_i_am_giving_away_free_copies_of_1984_by/), and I think it was quite successful! Everyone liked it. I received a LOT of requests! Most of the request came directly in my DMs, and it took a lot of time to finish all the orders! I am happy with it because I was able to fulfill all the book requests! 😃

After the wonderful response I received, I decided that I will do it again! So here I am again with another giveaway. I hope you all like this!

I was not sure which book to put up for this, I had a few in mind - 'The Origins of Totalitarianism', 'Fahrenheit 451', 'Brave New World'...and so on. These are some amazing books, but my whole point of doing this is to spread awareness, and spark critical thinking. These books help in doing just the same, but I realized that these might be a little too dense for some new readers, and they'll likely put down the book before even finishing it. There are no prerequisites required to read those books, but I think reading some other books before them, helps you grasp the former better!

I selected **Animal Farm.** It's just as relevant today as 1984! It seemed a perfect book to read after 1984, and before the ones I mentioned above. The book is short, and the language is pretty easy for new readers.

The world is awash in bullshit. Politicians are unconstrained by facts. Science is conducted by press release. Higher education rewards bullshit over analytic thought. We are living in the throes of a full-on fascist insurgency. Economic and ecological collapse are certainties at this point, and the consequences of these events will only accelerate the state's backslide into fascism as the ruling classes seek to consolidate their power. The majority of administrative activity, whether in private business or the public sphere, seems to be little more than a sophisticated exercise in the combinatorial reassembly of bullshit.

Here's a quote from the book itself:
> “Several of them would have protested if they could have found the right arguments.” 

This is high-time, but people are not informed and educated enough to know that this is high-time. They are being misguided, misinformed, and they're not aware how they can fall in this trap. They need to understand the mass psychology of fascism, and how it plays with their mind, and their biases, and complexes. How media is involved in this. How their prejudices come into play.

If you are interested in reading this, here's how you can get one.

I'll send the books through *Gift Registries*. This way you don't have to disclose your personal details and address to me. Gift registries are safe, from privacy point of view. I won't be able to see any Addresses/Mobile or anything, completely confidential.

Go to 'Your Account' > 'Your Addresses' > Click on Add Address > Save your full address including your mobile number > Click on 'Set as Default' to make that address your default [This is very important!]  > Now search for the book title, and add the book to your WishList > Remember to check the option 'Third party shipping agreement' when you create your WishList > And you're done!

After you're done with setting up your Gift Registry:

* You first need to request for the book by commenting on this post, so to get visibility, and I can add you to my list from there. This way I get to manage list of requests in a sequence.
* Now you need to DM me your wish-list link! Please don't copy the invite link, you need to copy the Wish-List link from 'Send list to others' button or directly from URL :)

Heres the short version

Thugs in front of me start a fight with me unprovoked because I did not stand up for the national anthem.

I get hit on the face and they incite a crowd against me. They close in and shouting threats to my life.

INOX PULLS ME OUT, and left the thugs there. Thank e manager was flippant towards me and when the police got involved he wrote his case report supporting the mob and against me.

The thugs basically write some hit down and are left free. I was detained for bogus charges for not standing up and 'hurting the dignity of the soverign nation'

Not one person stood up for me when a mob threated my life. I am absolutely disgusted with everyone that was present yesterday.

Im still seething from the injustice and urge you all to boycott inox. That was absolutely unacceptable.

14,How unethical/illegal is my doctor mom's behavior?,cy9zyu,india,423,False,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/cy9zyu/how_unethicalillegal_is_my_doctor_moms_behavior/,169,[R]eddiquette,"Mom is a gynecologist by profession. She has ties with some Medical representatives (MRs) where they give her medicine to sell directly at rate cheaper than the shop. She then sells that medicine to patients directly or sends them to the medical shop. Shopkeeper gives her all the money sold from the medicines back.

 She once showed me a brochure which contained different gifts based on number of tablets written . It was a Plasma TV for something like 8,500 tablets but she chose something else.

She also does this thing where she sends a 50rs injection to the medical shop (which dad owns but rents out to others) and writes  a different injection name on prescription paper worth Rs. 5,000. Patient pays 5k to shopkeeper who then brings the money, injection back to her. 

She was really frustrated when they introduced compulsory attendance of certain number of medical conferences per year for doctors. Luckily, MRs get the certificates of conferences for her so she doesn't have to attend a single one! She stores some medicines directly in the medical shop that MRs giver her which she writes and the shop owner gives some commission to her for them.

 She has tie ups with a pathologist, where every patient she refers to him, he gives certain amount of money back to her (like 30%) from his fees. Once, she was showing me pathologist's report for fun to read. I found value of platelet written - 45,000 and underline under it. Normal value written next to it was 150k I think. She said without even looking its 450k, read again. I double checked but nope it was 45,000. She looked at it and got very furious. She immediately called the pathologist and said how dare he didn't tell her immediately and only underline it for her. She said that patient would have gotten serious if not died with that low platelet count. She said, she will instead send all patients to a different pathologist who gives her more cashback from now on if he does something like this again. 

Once a civil surgeon came to check her records and she had them badly incomplete. I remember she was facing removal of her sonography machine at least. Luckily, dad went to meet the civil surgeon few times and paid him around ~1L to keep queit. Mom was complaining how stupid these records are, how much work she has to already do. How unfair this all is on her.

Mom casually mentioned she failed final year of her MBBS but dad paid a lecturer to pass her. How her diploma doesn't mean anything because it is from a non certified organization; but it has the same initials as the official diploma so people would get fooled into thinking she has one.


GORE AHEAD - Parents Hospital is on ground floor and we live upstairs. Growing up, I used to regularly see different meat like parts in a regular dustbin, next to her operation theater. Once a stray dog was eating what looked like placenta from the dustbin. She would pay money to some midwife to dispose off fetuses and bury them into ground somewhere secluded. She was pretty mad when someone complained about her throwing bio hazardous waste in the surrounding area which did she used to do I think.

She reminds me without fail regularly how much money she earns and how many people recognize her outside because she is doctor. How much respect doctors get in society. She would say would say none gets as much respect as doctors do. Once we were going for a family vacation and a bike going at speed got slammed by a car right in front of us. I asked dad shouldn't we stop and help them, aren't you guys doctors and are supposed to help?"" Dad said, ""Who is going to spend that much time taking him to nearest hospital? The guy is probably very serious if not dead already."" So, we chose to continue to our trip.

E: I never meant it as some sort of PSA.  It was more of a venting from my childhood memories . Mom has been very abusive to me and recalling those memories; I have lot of amnesia around them and it is very stressful, anxiety inducing. Its easy to type these ones out because they don't involve me. 

Also they might seem clear to you guys, but I have lived in that home for 21 years. My first memories are formed  while living with my mom. This is quite the norm in my house and I was exposed to only these values, culture, environment most of my life. Parents wouldn't let me go outside much either, I was suicidal for a long time. I am very gaslighted from living with them. It feels really nice to know these things are very looked down upon and every comment helps with the gaslighting.","Unethical or illegal they don't care. I have myself witnessed these things and many more like forced cesareans, delayed discharge when admitted, unnecessary tests,etc.

At 12pm, they had Dibang (Journalist) who was being interviewed by some other ABP news journalist. They were roaming the streets of Ayodhya while Dibang told what he saw on the day when Babri was demolished. The saffron *goondas* were already shouting ""Jai Shri Raam"" while he was talking in the mic.

4-5 minutes in, he described how all the politicians (Advani, Murli Manohar, Pramod Mahajan, Uma Bharti) were present there right in front of the structure  (Babri Mosque) when people started storming in and getting on top of the structure. The security and the politicians made absolutely no effort to stop them. They were there with hammer and rods and all kinds of weapon which were useful in destroying the structure. Everything was planned. 

**The important part**

7-8 minutes in and the broadcast stopped abruptly, showing advertisement out of nowhere (without any proper outro which you see usually). Then they kept showing  advertisement for 20-22 minutes and started a new show on 12:30pm.

But I have some questions about the security aspects.

1. Can anyone with a FAST Tag reader come and suck out the balance in the FAST tag wallet or is there a provision to enable authorization from the customer end to approve a transaction like an OTP system ?
2. Is it possible to disable the account when one is not driving on tollways and enable it only just before the toll booth ?
3. Is it possible to clone the Fast tag and use it for malicious activities or there are sufficient security provisions to prevent this ?
4. How can the customer know that the FAST tag reader was successful in debiting the money from the account ? Is an SMS sent to the mobile number of the customer and how much time does it take to receive this transaction SMS ? It would be of no use if the SMS is received only after the customer has crossed the tollbooth after paying by cash since it was told that the transaction failed.
4. Is there an app to view the transaction status and transaction history in case the transaction SMS is not received in time ?
5. Is there a danger of deduction of the amount twice or is there provision to prevent multiple deductions in quick succession ?
6. In case there is a dispute like wallet deducted twice etc. What is the dispute redressal and refund mechanism ?
7. Toll booths generally charge a lower amount if you pay for the return as well, in case you are returning the same day. Does FAST tag deduct a lower charge correspondingly in case you return the same day ?
8. If there is a queue before the toll booth because Fast tag reader is not working and everyone is paying by cash, which cancels the time that you might have saved by taking the toll road. In that case do we still have to pay the toll amount ?

These questions are very relevant as the government is making Fast tag mandatory..","You asked more questions than gov. I'm not gonna get it coz I don't go out of the city. No need for it. Unnecessary expense. Plus there still will be hybrid lanes. Also you think the ppl at toll are gonna live without cash, they'll get it from you somehow.

""Although it took India almost 20 years to win its first Test, it had long been evident that it belonged on the big stage, and some of its cricketers had been acknowledged as being among the best in the world. CK Nayudu and Vijay Merchant were both named Wisden Cricketers of the Year, after they toured England in 1932 and 1936 respectively, and Don Bradman had heaped praise upon Lala Amarnath and Vijay Hazare in his book, Farewell to Cricket. And, of course, there was that classic first session of play in India's debut Test against England at Lord's in 1932.

England, led by Douglas Jardine, won the toss and opted to bat. Their openers Herbert Sutcliffe (54 Tests, average 60.73) and Percy Holmes. Just a week ago, the pair had added a then-world-record 555 for first wicket in a county game. India wasn’t fazed.

Within an hour, England was 19 for 3, with London on the verge of a paramedical emergency - the crowd at Lord's was in a state of shock. The men responsible for this were Mohammad Nissar and Amar Singh, arguably India's best new-ball pair ever Nissar, perhaps the quickest bowler in the world at that time, yorked Sutcliffe in the first ball of his second over, beating him with pace. Last ball of that same over, Holmes's off stump came out of its hole the ground and did a jig in the air, as did the Indians. Shortly afterwards, Frank Wolley was run out, and England were in trouble.""

Source 2: https://www.cricketnetwork.co.uk/main/s119/st26334.php

""In fact Mohammad Nissar and his partner Ladha Amar Singh formed one of the most formidable pair of fast bowlers in the world at the dawn of Indian Test cricket. It is one of the tragedies of Indian cricket that both were lost to the game rather early. Amar Singh died young, at the tender age of 29 from a bout of severe pneumonia, and Nissar too did not keep in the best of health and was not picked for any Tests after 1936. Upon Partition, Nissar moved to Lahore in Pakistan where he died prematurely, just barely past 50. Unfortunate circumstances thus prevented Nissar and Amar Singh from passing on their legacy to Indian cricket, much to its detriment. If the pace bowling standards they achieved had been maintained, India never would have suffered the fast-bowling drought it did from the late 1930s to the late 1970s. This forty year dry spell had the nation thirsting for a genuine fast bowler, until Kapil Dev finally slaked that thirst when he arrived on the scene with the sound and fury of the first thunderstorm of a new monsoon, while tiny Ramakant Desai provided some brief showers of relief, albeit insufficient to quench the thirst, in the late 1950s and early 1960s.""

""Chasing an improbable 346 for a win, India crumbled under pressure but Amar proved his worth as a handy batsman. He, in fact, scored a blazing half-century and in the process became the first Indian to hit a fifty.

Interestingly, Amar was also the first Indian to hit a six when he sent one out of the park during his 51-run innings in that game.

However, eight years after making debut, tragedy struck as Amar died on May 21 in 1940 from pneumonia at his residence in Jamnagar. He was aged 29.""

Source 4: https://www.sportskeeda.com/cricket/mohammad-nissar-indias-fastest-pre-partition-bowler

“  ""Nissar was a magnificent bowler and a great sportsman, who was an asset to any team of his time. A great slip fielder who could bring off surprising catches in spite of his weight. I have not seen a faster bowler than him in this sub-continent.”

These were the words used by Indian all-rounder Jahangir Khan (father of Majid Khan and uncle of Imran Khan), who played India’s first 4 Tests, to describe his teammate Mohammad Nissar.""

Source 5: https://madcrazyhatter.wordpress.com/2013/06/08/forgotten-heroes-amar-singh-and-mohammad-nissar/

""On the first morning, 21-year old speedster Mohammad Nissar sent England into disarray by knocking over the stumps of both Sutcliffe and Holmes. Soon, his new ball partner, Amar Singh (also 21) bowled the great Wally Hammond. Within a few hours, England were staring down the barrel of a huge embarrassment at 166/6 and it was two new bowlers who had inflicted that damage. Today, when we talk about Indian legends, names like Tendulkar, Gavskar, Kumble and Kapil pop up regularly. Some more informed and well-read folks dig up names like Mankad, Hazare, Prasanna, Lala Amarnath and Umrigar.

39,People don't understand the differences between the army and the paramilitary. BUT THEY MUST.,ar504q,india,2263,False,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/ar504q/people_dont_understand_the_differences_between/,137,[R]eddiquette,"So I was talking to a friend yesterday who was disturbed by the recent Pulwama attack and during the conversation she referred to the victims as the Indian army soldiers. It wasn't very surprising for me as I've been seeing this misconception for years, even among the educated lot of the country. However, the cowardly attack on CRPF really boiled my blood and I strongly felt that they deserved to be addressed as who they are. And they are not the army. 

Following five forces were earlier considered paramilitary forces, but from March 2011 have been reclassified as Central Armed Police Forces to avoid confusion with Assam Rifles and Special Frontier Force (SFF):

    Central Reserve Police Force (CRPF) 
    Border Security Force (BSF) 
    Indo-Tibetan Border Police (ITBP) 
    Central Industrial Security Force (CISF) 
    Sashastra Seema Bal (SSB)

CRPF is like the first responder for almost all of the internal security or ""war-like"" situations whereas the army is brought in during the war. CRPF faces the stone pelters in Kashmir. It is they who face bullets of the naxals. BSF guards our borders, not the army always. They have to make way for the army when a war is imminent. ITBP is stationed along the Indo-Tibetan border protects us from the Chinese forces. 

The CRPF or the CAPF in general, comes under the Ministry Of Home Affairs while the army comes under the Ministry Of Defence. MHA has almost equal number of mouths to feed, if not more, compared to the MoD but the MoD takes a substantially bigger piece of the budget pie everytime because MoD procurements are expensive (remember Rafale? I only wonder how all that extra money could have been utilized).

CAPF is not treated on par with the army even in terms of pay & perks. 

>A low-ranking army soldier typically receives one-and-a-half times the pay of a CRPF officer of equivalent experience

>“We’re like a body,” he said, referring to all the security forces, including the army. “Just because the heart is more important, you can’t ignore the knee.”

CAPF personnel live in very poor and conflict ridden conditions for very extended periods of time (remember the BSF jawan's viral video complaining low standards of food?). The conditions that they live in are so dire that diseases like malaria, dengue, heart attacks, depression and suicides kill 16 times more CRPF personnel in maoist hit regions compared to those slain by the rebels. 

>Junior home minister Hansraj Gangaram Ahir told the Lok Sabha that 74 CRPF personnel were killed in offensives against the rebels, while 1,196 lost their lives because of medical reasons. In a written reply, the minister said 219 jawans succumbed to heart attacks, 77 died because of depression or by committing suicide, and 20 due to malaria and dengue. Another 880 died due to ""other"" unspecified medical reasons.

They even have a hard time rehabilitating after retirements. Suicide rates are very high in the paramilitary both during and post service.

> Nearly 700 personnel of the Central Armed Police Forces committed suicide in the last six years, more than those killed in action, the Union Home Ministry has told a parliamentary panel. The reasons include ""lack of stability, loneliness and domestic strife"".

TL;DR:

We comfortably deify the army but we don't understand that it is not just the army that is keeping us safe. Being able to make this distinction between our various forces gives us the ability to address their critical concerns. Let us not be so thankless. Let us not be so ignorant. Let us give these brave CAPF soldiers the recognition and status they deserve. 

But more importantly let us pay them well for their services because they are not just fighting for honour, they are also fighting to feed their loved ones, to send their kids to college, to build a house, to pay their old parents' medical bills. In addition to fighting for the country,  these soldiers are fighting for themselves like you and me.

Such crises appear to the public slowly. I consider the current situation is only first round of crisis.\*

&#x200B;

• Increasing the NPA of banks means. Scarcity of capital which means no fresh investment. The glorification of bankrupt law and Continuous scams in companies

• Homes are not being sold which means sale of  steel, cement, bathroom fittings, construction declining. With this banks NPAs will grow. These NPAs go deep into individual level by making the crisis deeper,

• Vehicle sales are declining. At present first time in the country sale of  two wheelers are showing negative growth. Maruti has cut down production by 50%. Many of the auto dealers are closing down. This means  there is substantial reduction demand for steel, tyre and other accessories.

In such a situation, the government properties are sold in multiples of their favorite corporate and the losses increase.

Crisis in India will be visible around March 2020, Most of the average Indians are unaware about this.  It's time to be careful when you are not able to sell soap, shampoo and detergent.

For the past few years, even the  FMCG sector is  also in the  grip of recession-. Do you remember  when you have  last seen Baba Ramdev's Patanjali Company's advertisement?  Patanjali was most active on TV about 2 years back., but for last one year, the condition of even Patanjali  which grew at the fastest pace in India's FMCG market is alarming.. Sales of Patanjali's products is shrinking.  Apart from this, Patanjali Ayurveda has shown 10% Revenue Deficit in FY 2018. Not only companies such as Patanjali but Hindustan Lever also have come down in growth. Demand for fast-selling consumer goods such as soap, toothpaste, hair oil, biscuits etc. has decreased considerably in rural areas. This has also slowed down the performance of those businesses, which are dependent on healthy rural demand. It includes FMCG, two-wheeler and auto companies that make entry-level cars.

Now come on the transport-According to the  report of the Indian Foundation of Transport Research and Training,  15% drop in truck rentals has reported since November 2018.  Also Fleet Utilization has dropped more than that. All 75 trunk routes, rentals have gone down substantially. Between April and June, Fleet Utilization has decreased 25% to 30% compared to the first quarter of last year. This also reduces the income of transporters by about 30%. Many operators may also come in the Fleet's EMI default in the next quarter.

There is a clear impact on the freight demand because of reduction in industrial production. Demand from the manufacturing sector, which contributes the most to truck transport, is at minimum level. Consumers spending in cities and rural areas have reduced and transportation in agriculture has almost become sluggish after the peak demand of April. In June, the demand for fruits and vegetables by FMCG has decreased by 20%.

Due to the decrease of the freight demand, truck fleet has reduced by 30% on all major routes of the country in the first quarter.","Are you sure there will be a recession, or just a slowdown? A recession would imply negative growth rates, which would be catastrophic in a developing country like India. ",2019-08-08 00:26:54

Another interesting thing about net-metering with rooftop solar is that when you generate excess electricity during the day, your neighbors who don't have rooftop solar end up bearing the hidden costs of electricity transmission/distribution/generation. This will become an issue when a larger number of people start adopting solar power and there is no demand and cost based correction of units accrued by excess solar generation. ",2020-10-28 14:05:41

Coupled  with great bank offers I bought it all, saving a substantial sum of  money. While I was seeing all these ""No Cost"" EMI offers on online  shopping portals since years, I never gave them a thought because 1.) I  never remotely needed them, and 2.) I am distrustful of any mechanism  which enables people to shop unnecessary things beyond their means. This  time around the figure was substantial, and for the first time paying  it upfront in the next cycle meant I'd have little liquid balance in my  account. Nothing I couldn't manage, but I thought to myself, if for no  additional cost I can split this into 3 payments - why the hell not try  it?

And thus I popped my Credit Card EMI cherry. I did the math several  times before payment - yes, the final amount I would be paying (EMIs x 3  months) was exactly the same as my current cart value. (There was one  item attracting a little interest that was explicitly not covered by the  scheme, which I didn't mind shelling out, so I will ignore that for  this discussion.) In case you do not know, here's a brief on how it  works. No one can give you a 0% interest loan as per RBI norms, so No  Cost EMI is not a 0% rate loan. Then how do the total payments match the  exact value of upfront payment? What they do is that a special discount  is applied on the bill IF you choose to pay the EMI way (which is borne  by the bank but also partially by the merchant). This discount is such  that when the standard EMI calculation with 15% interest is done, the  sum of EMIs is the same as the actual bill amount. I'll illustrate the  numbers for a 6 month EMI conversion on a bill of Rs. 10,000:

Upfront Payment = Rs. 10,000

No Cost EMI discount = Rs. 429

Net Principal = Rs. 9,571

EMI for 6 months @ 15% = Rs. 1667

Total EMI Payment = Rs. 10,002

Pretty neat, and a clear win for you, huh? Not so fast, Mojo Jojo.

Any EMI loan creation charges your card with a Rs. 199 fee, +18% GST -  that's Rs. 235. Since you've converted a Rs. 10,000 purchase into EMI,  you've already spent an extra 2.35%. Next up, card purchases made with  EMI structure do not earn any points. Even the most basic of credit  cards provide points worth 0.7% to 0.9% of purchase value. Now, let's  get to the fun part. Just like creation of EMI loan, every payment of  EMI interest is also considered a service and thus attracts 18% GST.  Yes, you read that right - the entire interest portion (= EMI discount)  is taxed at 18%, which turns out to be Rs. 77 here, so another 0.77%. On  the net, that's around 4% of your value that you are going to be paying  extra.

I am aware that 4% of product value does not seem too much of a cost  for financing Rs. 10,000 over 6 months, especially in absolute terms.  But fact remains that it is not ""No Cost"" in the true sense of the word.  Bump this up to Rs. 1 Lakh and the fees, lost points and taxes add up  to about 2% of bill amount, or Rs. 2,000. It is not a small amount by  any means, and you would be burning into some of the discounts which  made you get into the deals in the first place. It is a shitty practice  on the part of the banks/card issuers and I felt this needed a  descriptive analysis. I searched and searched before signing up for  this, and all I found out about was the Rs. 199 fees - the lost points  and GST on interested was a complete surprise for me.

Again, I'm not bashing or regretting the deal, as it is a convenience  and a ""not bad"" deal for financing when in a pinch and something you  need is on a great deal. My point is that there's quite a bit of hidden  charges you'd end up paying and banks find it in their interest to not  show these explicitly in an accessible way, presumably to get people to  buy shit they don't need using money they haven't earned yet. If you're  one of those people, do reconsider your decision.

Edit: I might have jumped the gun assuming all banks levied the 199 charge - as I have learnt that many banks do not. So that bit might be specific to my case, i.e., HDFC Bank.","I'm glad you noticed this, reminds me of something similar that real estate companies do. I was employed as a consultant for a real estate spe of a large player in india. we'd structure their loans through some similar juggling so the company could claim they're providing zero interest loans through their partners on their flats. Then they aggressively market the zero interest scheme iby using some popular celeb, feels like you're cheating the end buyer. ",2020-11-05 19:15:14

I was bored so I used BeautifulSoup and Python scripting to scrape the IPL's 2020 website and dumped all player data into a spreadsheet. It contains team-wise player data, batting and balling statistics, as well as overall record-holders available on the site. I'm not an active fantasy league participant per se, but I know people like to create their own teams and I thought this could help.

You can find the sheet [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1mwkeDNJGwcNZI6OgWF73meGIhgEd5aJ3Imaim14T8KU/edit?usp=sharing).

I wanted this to be a one evening effort, so please let me know if you guys think something could be added or improved. For one, the sheet does not have a column for the batting/bowling style of the players, because those were json objects and I was a little lazy creating a separate dictionary for them, and also because those details are usually found on fantasy league apps/websites while choosing players. I could add it as an improvement later on.

If this was helpful and anyone wishes to obtain updated values through the tournament, please let me know and we can figure out an update schedule, perhaps. Hope IPL can reduce the boredom this lockdown has set-in.

I saw some posts by people in inter-faith relationships so I thought I'd post my experience as the son of an inter-faith marriage. For those of you who don't know the love jihad panic has taken route in India's Christian communities as well, especially in Kerala.

My mother is a Roman Catholic from Karnataka and my father is a Sunni Muslim from Tamil Nadu who met and married while working in Dubai in the 1990s. So two minority religions from two different states. My parents liked each other because they shared many of the same world views. Both came from two small villages and only went up to 12th. My mother's family were small farmers my father's small businessmen

At the time both families opposed the marriage. The love jihad myth didn't exist that much in the 1990s but there were still warnings on how you'd have to wear a burqa and how just because he's liberal now he will become conservative after marriage. Regardless they married, and both families accepted it and put aside all biases after they had their first child. Though my mom sometimes gets the cold shoulder when she visits my father's home from everyone there except father-in-law, my grandpa, who has always been very open and liberal given the era and atmosphere he grew up in.

If you're wondering what religion I am, it's Roman Catholic, but I have an extremely Muslim name that came from my mom's strong desire to name me after multiple Mughal kings. This name really impresses older Muslims and younger Muslims laugh at it. I don't mind though. I'm open to all religions and have gone to mosques with on Eid, however since my mom was more religious than my dad I was raised Catholic along with my brother and did all the major Catholic sacraments (baptism, communion, confirmation etc.). This was never opposed by my Muslim father who attended all of them. My mom tried to get me baptised in Dubai but the priest was terrified that he'd get in trouble for baptizing a Muslim man's son even though my dad was present and said he was fine. My parents moved to Canada when I was 3 so my baptism happened there.

In Canada your identification by broader society is more on your race so the religious and ethnic differences between Indians (though present) are not as important to the Indians who grew up in Canada. But still quite important to the immigrants. Because of that even how 'love jihad' propaganda has impacted that mindsets of Indian Christians. Whenever someone finds out that my parents are interfaith and I get the same few questions....

1. Does your mom wear hijab/burqa? A: Burqa never. Hijab? Only when visiting her in-laws out of respect. Other than that she never covers her head, and my dad never once asked her to. She mostly wears western clothes in Canada and salwar in india.

2. Does your dad allow you to go to church? A: yes, since childhood. there's even a giant portrait of Mary and Jesus that my mom hangs in their bedroom. he didn't object to that either.

3. Will you dad force you to marry a Muslim? A: No.

I answer these questions hoping they'll get over their love jihad stereotype, but instead they double down and tell me about how they know a girl who married a Muslim and now their life is just awful. Something I notice is that when you press them you realize they don't know them they just heard a story from someone who heard a story from someone else. 

Having met people born out of few Muslim man-X woman couples I've found none conform to this stereotype of the liberal Muslim man turns Orthodox and controlling post-marriage. But I also notice a double-standard in relationships. Inter faith and inter caste marriages must be perfect in everywhere otherwise they are proof that breaking community lines was a bad idea. By this I mean if a Muslim man marries a Hindu woman and abuses her that's love jihad, warn everyone! But if a Hindu man marries a Hindu woman and abuses her, this is a personal matter and we shouldn't get involved. I even recall after the political normalization of Kashmir memes were spreading on FB of people joking they could now get a fair-skinned Kashmiri wife, which seemed very creepy. But was justified as men just joking. Though I wonder what would happen if Kashmiri Muslim men made this joke in reverse.

I notice the same thing in Canada for Indian-Canadians (Indians born in Canada) who marry outsider their race, any hint of trouble and relatives will say 'see what happens when you out-marry'. However if they have an arranged marriage within the community, then any amount of trouble of abuse will be tolerated and overlooked.

The origin of the 'love jihad' paranoia I think is more universal. Since Muslim men marry out more than Muslim woman it creates a sense of hostility or a belief that these arrangements are unfair or coordinated. I've seen this play out among Black woman in Canada since Black men marry outside their race more often and also in reverse with Chinese/Filipino men since Chinese/Filipino women marry outside their race more. However, India is much more clannish than Canada and politicians and major organizations found they had a lot to gain from feeding into this 'they're stealing out women' paranoia.",Your father could be one of the exception and it cannot be used as a blanket for every other inter religion marriage. ,2020-11-24 22:38:44

She is Fine !!!

My updated post is not coming up on the sub , hence updating here :

\--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Update :

 

We went up to the doctor at 8 am.

He came by 8:35 . He checked and he said everything's under control - and increased her dosage of anitbiotics.

Not satisfied with his volatile judgements - after that we went up to 2 more renowned doctors in Howrah, Kolkata and both of them stipulated that she can recover within the next 4 days, though her low BP is something serious - but with adequate salts, it will come to normal levels.

I am happy, All 3 doctors have stipulated that she is safe though she has to drink a lot of water and eat food . Her drastic weight loss according to the doctors was not because of typhoid but because of her low intake of food.

Psychologically, my sister feels a lot more better though physically she is weak- a condition the doctor said will sustain for the next 4 days or so because of high power antibiotics.

I want to take this post to specifically thank a few people (I am sorry I couldn't personally message you) so I am updating your name here :

The support I have received from you is incomparable . The fact and the gesture that you showed with offering money when we are complete Internet Strangers showcases how good is still left in the world. From the bottom of my heart, thank you for your support, which I believe to both of your joys, I won't need :)

To [u/princessa\_k17](https://www.reddit.com/u/princessa_k17/) \- Thank you for your kind words. They were endearing and were really helpful.

It's the internet - I never expected anyone to believe me let alone be ready to loan money. I came here partly to vent and partly to get some further suggestions and I completely agree if you think me to be a cheat. If you believe I am trying to garner sympathy ([u/Direct\_Equivalent](https://www.reddit.com/u/Direct_Equivalent/)) I am not - I was telling something true- but I completely understand if you think I am trying to feed on human emotions - I am not that guy if you would have met me in real life. To [u/banchod85](https://www.reddit.com/u/banchod85/) \- I had already mentioned in the Kolkata thread that I and my sister live here in a cheap PG for studies and articleship - My parents originally stay in Siliguri - My mother had come up 15 days before here - Hence, we didn't know about the government hospitals very well.

I messaged the mods that I am ready to provide any documentation to prove that this is true - still haven't received a word from them - though now it's not required, all is fine :)

To [u/ManifestDestiny1](https://www.reddit.com/u/ManifestDestiny1/) \- We didn't know - We took him on his word , I don't want to disclose the doctor's name here because I don't think that would be correct - Should I PM you the doctor's name ?

All in all, Reddit has been wonderful ! The multitude of both support and criticism has been overwhelming. Thank you to everyone whether you called me fishy or you supported me - but you showed interest in my case - which counts. I thank you from the bottom of my hearts and wish to God that all of you have a great and a disease-free life ahead.

P.S : I hand-typed all the names , If there was an error, please tell me the same , I will correct it. Apologies in advance for that :)

Lots of people are already too late to this race as soon as they're born. According to NASA, most geniuses become geniuses because the smartest sperm usually wins when trying to fertilize the egg and according to AYUSH Ministry's latest research (using vedic knowledge and sanskrit computation) an ancient secret has been unearthed that could allow you to produce the smartest sperm of the highest quality. There are some very important rules that one must follow in order to achieve this:

1) You must prevent all leakage of your sperm for a period of 3 years (and if any sperm are lost, you have to consume them back orally to ensure that the knowledge chakra remains unbroken)

2) In order for this advanced ancient technique to work correctly, you must follow the path of brain re-education. 

3) Our startup has a brain re-education program that will teach you how to code like bill gates (chief software developer who founded microsoft), steve jobs (the smartest coder who create apple) and larry page (world's greatest surviving genius who created google)

4) For a period of 3 years, all you have to do is put on our learning helmet for 6 hours a day. This helmet contains neural sensors that directly feed audio and video INTO your brain. The helmet also has advanced AI and machine learning that allows it to study your brain and reorganise it. Effectively re educating it.

5) Not only this, but the helmet also has a mini havan slot into which you put havan samagri and while you are being re educated, the smoke from this personal havan will connect you to the souls of the dead geniuses of the world with blessings from lord ganesha and saraswati ji.

Your asphyxiation is our guarantee. We promise that any brain cells left over at the end of this program will be enough for you to function as the worlds smartest programmer. But because of the constant havans you will be rendered utterly paraplegic - fear not though, your super sperm is now ready to be planted in a womb.

143,"Folks from Mumbai in their 30s with no family links for arrange marriage proposals, nor anyone available to date, how's it going?",jujong,india,46,False,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/jujong/folks_from_mumbai_in_their_30s_with_no_family/,100,AskIndia,"A bit of my background to give context. I'm 32 \[M\] and have have been seeking a life parter through various means since 4 years. I live in Mumbai with my parents. I am better than average looking, in good health, accomplished in my job, earning very well, people who know me find me helpful, non-smoker/ non-drinker and have a couple of hobbies that i've become good at. I'm not extroverted, but comfortable to talk with anyone. My negatives are that I am not a romantic person, I can become frustrated on small things specifically during challenging times (but I cool down quite easily) and I am quite laid back about life (not very ambitious). I belong to a financially stable family and my dad has a good reputation in the business industry (now retired), yet we live moderately and have a simple lifestyle. I have no siblings and parents are senior citizens now. Like a typical dynamic with relatives in most people's lives, only my mothers' family side are in good terms with us.

Here's my experience while seeking a life partner in past 4 years:

1. Only 1 relationship so far out of my own search - where the girl didn't have the courage to convince her parents. We parted ways eventually.
2. Following which, I have been in the arrange marriage alliance chaos meeting through marriage portals or middlemen. ̱Most of the times, I get rejected for staying in a 1BHK house  (even though we own it) and not having a car. Sometimes it's only that parents are interested, but girls aren't at all. Sometimes I reject if the girl has too many conditions or we seem incompatible or if she is one of the ""men have and still continue to oppress women"" types.
3. Despite all this, I've had 5 matches so far where the girl and I liked each other. In 3 cases (one of them through maternal relations), the fathers were unwilling to get their daughters married in Mumbai. In 1 case, my dad's friend brought forward her brother's daughter's' alliance (who's engagement once broke due to money demands from guy's end). But her parents did not like us because of \*drumroll\* our 1 BHK house, and only dad's friend was pushing things ahead and girl and I liked each other. And eventually the girl's father postponed the roka with vague reasons and it turned out to be because ""we weren't offering them show-off worthy jewellery"". I met the girl, explained and politely said we cannot proceed ahead. And in 1 case, I almost got married to a girl who's family was super desperate to tie the knots ASAP and I later found the girl had steep mood swings, had a history of fainting during work and her health issues never got clarified! I was an idiot here to even allow the quick marriage no matter what pressure.
4. We have never demanded nor favoured dowry. We are more interested in associated with a good family.

Now as a 32 year old man, I don't get alliances anymore. I had always been in favour of arrange marriages from known links, because I prefer the idea of clearing the needs and expectations between families. Love becomes possible when ""core"" needs and expectations are similar! However, I don't have this privilege. And it seems nearly impossible to find someone decent to date who isn't dating just for hookups! I genuinely want to settle down and have a family of my own. But with the current package of experiences, and the rise of pseudo-feminism, I don't know anymore. I am now unable to trust any stranger with no common links in between! And now as a last resort, I am exploring ways for alternatives to marriage and still live a good life with enough love around (although I am not very fond of this idea). After-all, we are all social beings and we all need a support system!

I even looked into single parent surrogacy and unfortunately it seems it's banned for single parents now.

I have informed my friends to keep an eye if they know anyone suitable. But I am not keeping hopes!

So folks who are acquainted with someone in a similar circumstance or someone who themselves are in such a situation/ or have moved on from this, can you share your experiences on how you got out of this? Or anything else you did to improve your situation? Please do make the comments useful, as I am sure there are more people who are in as similar situation (be it males or females) and it will perhaps help all of us!","Why do you want to marry?

They tried to make him give false statements that he'd eloped with a Hindu girl and they'd free him and that the girl would be in favor of him. Good thing the watchman had warned him not to do so.

The Government of India on June 5 announced 3 ordinances. These will become bills as the monsoon session of parliament commences. 

These laws seek to end the MSP system which supports the 70% of the population of this country. 82% of the farmers have small land holding and this will destroy them along with their families.

The Farmers (Empowerment and Protection) Agreement on Price Assurance and Farm Services Ordinance essentially talks about contract farming that allows farmers to sell their produce outside of the APMC via a “framework for farmers to enter into direct contracts with those who wish to buy farm produce”.

The amendment to the Essential Commodities Act (ECA), 1955 — which originally “empowers the central government to control the production, supply, distribution, trade, and commerce in certain commodities” — aims to protect the farmers’ income as well as the consumers’ interest. 

The amendment constitutes a new sub-section (1), which overrides Section 3, by limiting the powers of both central and state governments in regulating and imposing stock limitations on commodities. 
Regulations can now be imposed only in extraordinary circumstances that include “war, famine, extraordinary price rise and natural calamity of grave nature”. 

The Implication of these amendments is that the minimum support price which every farmer is guaranteed for his produce will be done with. And farmers will be forced to sell their crop to private corporations and companies. The capitalists to maximise their profits will bleed the farmers dry. Approximately 40,000 farmers commit suicide every year 
and almost every farmer is in debt. THUS , THESE LAWS WILL FASTEN THE DEATH OF A COMMUNITY ALREADY CHOKING TO DEATH.","To all those asking for source of MSP being done away with, it is in the amendment to Essential Commoditise act. The amendement will not allow government to to control prices unless there are some certain extreme conditions. 

Edit: Still trying to look into sources regarding MSP system but from these amendments , this looks like its gonna be go. ",2020-09-14 01:56:23

3. Returning customers are almost non-existent.

Link to the case - [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National\_Federation\_of\_the\_Blind\_v.\_Target\_Corp.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Federation_of_the_Blind_v._Target_Corp.)

&#x200B;

**Problem**

I see a lot of web-sites which are not designed well enough for even an able-person to use, let go of a disabled person, are active and being used day-to-day. And to make my concern reasonable and serious, the central and state-level **government maintained web-sites are not capable of handling people with disabilities**.

I think it's high time we raise this concern with the Indian Government as more and more processes and applications are getting online and visiting offices physically is not practical now a days. This will help 2.21% (2.68 crore people as of year 2016)[\[2\]](http://mospi.nic.in/sites/default/files/publication_reports/Disabled_persons_in_India_2016.pdf) able to perform tasks which can be done online, at least.

&#x200B;

**Solution**

[Accessibility Guidelines Working Group](https://www.w3.org/WAI/GL/) has come up with ""Web Content Accessibility Guidelines"" which consists of guidelines for a web-site to follow so that it can be fully functional to support people with disabilities and make their like easier.

Having been working for 10 years, for the first time in my life I worked from a city where I wasn't an immigrant, from my family home.

Aware and acknowledge my privilege that I have it easier with almost complete autonomy of my living space, lifestyle etc.

The Internet speeds are excellent, power supply is slight bummer - but nothing an inverter didn't solve. Cost of living is supremely cheap compared to living by yourself as well. Most importantly, the salaries of BOM/BLR/DEL in a tier 2 town with minimal spend is beautifully balanced and spends are majorly in the wants/good-to-haves as opposed to need-to-haves purchases.
Additionally, I have always battled a certain guilt about ignoring/leaving my parents alone while diving into work / my own personal life - this feels absolutely great.

WFH has led to higher productivity for me because I want to finish work as soon as possible and no chai sutta breaks with colleagues which slow work down.

My personal preference would be a good to have 5 days a month in office, and rest wherever I want to be, for the rest of my working life.

I'm a recently graduated MBBS doctor. Just as I graduated, Covid duties hit us in full strength and it's exhausting, and mentally traumatising to see so many patients go through the struggle that it is. Leave that, that's a whole story for another day. 

Our government everyday comes up with new rules which are changing our medical education even as we speak. If mixing allopathy and other pathys wasn't enough, in a Group of Ministers (GoM) announcement LED BY THE AYUSH MINISTER, they want to reduce MBBS to 4.5 years so that more time can be given to rural postings only after which degree will be given. Also, other pathys will also be integrated into the curriculum. 

Here are a few thoughts: 
1. Just as with the farmers' bill, why are the stakeholders not involved in such crucial decisions? Why are we just told about such things, which could have lasting impact on the healthcare system of our nation? Do we as doctors who have gone through the system, not have a right to give our opinion on it? 


2. Rural posting has been an issue since ages. The reason we can't have doctors in rural areas is because THERE AREN'T FACILITIES FOR RUNNING A HOSPITAL OR EVEN A TINY PHC. I've worked in Badlapur- close to Mumbai - PHC (which was incidentally run by an Ayurvedic physician), and there wasn't even Aspirin I could give to a patient with suspected heart attack. How can any doctor help in such cases? We have the knowledge but without simple things like Xray availability or even an ECG machine how can emergency cases also be handled? How can the government just announce TWO YEARS to be devoted to areas where there's no support? 


3. Although I chose this profession, I didn't choose all this that has come with it. Why are engineering students not made to work in rural areas? Or do compulsory bonds? So many take their degrees and leave the country. So many get 1 crore placement packages fresh out of college. Whereas I get measly 6000 Rs as an intern working 65 hours a week, in emergency, Covid etc wards, and then have to pack my bags to go to work in villages? When engineers can contribute in so many ways to building up health resources for doctors and nurses to work in?


4. This year due to Covid, salaries were delayed in all BMC and government medical colleges. Delhi residents went on hunger strike when salary wasn't given for 4 MONTHS. So many post MBBS bond officers didn't get salary and not even PPE when working in their rural health posts. When are we going to address the fact that there's glaring lack of compassion and respect for healthcare workers? Why isn't the Government working to ensure safety and pay for these doctors? Don't we have families to feed? Children to send to schools? Our ""kindness"" won't pay the bills, now will they? 


5. This is a grave mistake, the mixing of pathys. Internationally, Indian doctors are renowned for their knowledge and hard work. All that respect will go down the drain once the international medical community sees the dilution of allopathy. Research is dismal, but will become non-existent once this happens. This is extremely regressive and in the long run will only lead to the further crumbling of our very weak healthcare system. 


I sound angsty and angry and that's perhaps because I am. I'm tired of continuously fighting for my right to my education and my right to earn my money in peace. At the end of the day, a doctor is a professional. There's money to be earned, families to take care of, educational debts to be paid off. We start our careers much later than most, and need to earn enough to sustain ourselves. If the government doesn't take our entire lives and education into account before announcing such huge decisions, how will we progress as a nation?","> so that more time can be given to rural postings only after which degree will be given

I absolutely agree with the govt's decision. No doctor is going to goto a rural area, even to their native because there is no money to earn. If govt doesn't step in, a vast majority of the people are not going to get healthcare.

He published well. Infact he published more than many students from good institutes abroad.

&#x200B;

Now he has been trying to find a foot in the job market for close to a year. Salaries offered are in the range of 20 to 25k per month. The scholarship used to be more than that. One cannot live a basic life in Mumbai or Bengaluru with 25k.

The situation is the same for PhDs and post docs who return from abroad. There are very few faculty openings, and most industries don't care about innovation or research. Many students with good masters by research degrees from the US universities also find themselves unemployed in India. Someone from UT Austin returned last year with a masters in mech engineering and was offered less than 30k INR for a job in Mumbai despite having some work ex in mechanical design and simulations.

The job market in India has very few companies and most of them are catering to a niche set of skills for customers abroad.

I still don't get why Indian companies are so averse to innovation and development in India. Except pharma and to some extent automobiles, few are developing products and solutions that can solve Indian problems and be exported globally. An example- that's why you see a small country like Thailand exporting billions worth of agriculture products like seafood, vegetables etc. while India still imports a large chunk of the fish sold in restaurants- we simply don't care to understand and develop the processing tools and facilities for such activities.

Google or Facebook may hire a few employees in India every year and many of us think that India is some tech superpower. It is not. **Tech is not just digital products, it is about using engineering to create value in various industries, from agriculture to environment monitoring and transportation etc**.

If you are an Indian, don't bother doing any substantial engineering education here. Companies don't care and will happily hire the fresher with no experience bit often with an MBA over a qualified PhD or MS graduate with rich experience.

TLDR: except software product and service companies, there's no scope for innovation in India. Talent is not respected. That's why Indian companies don't fare anywhere in world rankings.

For the longest time, I upheld patriarchy and believed it to be the way of life. And then one day, instead of acting like a submissive woman, I acted like a dominant man. In my mind, I was just imitating my father. I was doing what he does - insulting my mother when angry. But I was immediately asked to change my ways. I was told I shouldn't get angry as women are meant to be soft spoken, I was told I couldn't imitate my father as I am a woman.

Ripple effect led me to the realization of what Patriarchy meant and how it was subjugating my gender. I studied it further and realised how it affected other genders. I studied further and became an advocate for an equal society. 

But when I looked back to catch my breath and indulge in some friendly banter, I realised there were just some women around me and a few countable men far away. 

Like some, I learnt better. I educated myself on issues and advocated for equality. But I don't see men coming as far as the women on this issue. Some take up the fight but stop as soon as it becomes a little inconvenient for them. 

Patriarchy has its perks, I understand. But at what cost? Seems like women are paying a much higher price! And this leaves little to no motivation for the men to become our allies in bashing this poisonous system.

I, an Indian woman, am mentally preparing myself to lead a bachelorette life because I have little hope of finding someone compatible.

I have dated men. I regularly become acquainted with new men. I meet some who come close to the views I hold but it never goes all the way. It's as if they stop exploring the ill-effects of patriarchy as soon as they realise how they themselves uphold it and advocate for it subtly or non-subtly.

How do you cling to such views that are giving sub-standard quality of life to a major chunk of the human population? Do you not feel guilty? Don't your moral and ethic codes make you want to change your ways permanently?

So little you want to learn, so little you prioritize.

All it takes is a kind heart and an empathetic soul. But I guess it's a rare combination to find in the men of our country.

The ad goes like this. Ranveer is searching for a good potato to make chips out of but instead of a supermarket, it's a city of live walking animate potatoes. To find the good potato, he pretends that he tripped and throws his briefcase full of cash on the ground. A group of potatoes immediately flock around him trying to take that money when a much younger potato (with a very cute childlike voice) chases them off and gives the briefcase back to Ranveer. Ranveer then exclaims that he finally found the accha aalo (good potato) and crowns him (literally) as the good potato.

Cut to the next scene, an animation of a potato being peeled and made into chips is shown.

Now I know that the company wants to show that they only make chips out of good potatoes that are thoroughly searched for, but the only vibe I get from that ad is that good people die. A cute and innocent baby potato who did good was skinned and sliced and fried. Now that seems messed up. That's it, that's all I wanted to say. The idea was good but the fact that an ethically good person (or potato, but they had animate features) went down like that is messed up.

Edit: I'm not against the ad. I liked [Sausage Party](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WVAcTZKTgmc) and enjoy videos by [HowToBasic](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCR4s1DE9J4DHzZYXMltSMAg)

I had a friend from Bangalore at the time when i was a student in Cyprus about 12 years ago, once his mother sent him a package with Indian food, and each was more delicious than the other. 

Yet there was this one i just can't forget about. I've been searching every possible way i can to find it yet fail every time. When I asked him he said it was ""dried (or dry) fish pickles"" but googling that brings up a completely different dish.

I'll try to describe it in bullet points with the best memory i can recall


* Made from fish, can't remember what fish
* Very spicy, made me cry while eating, but i couldn't stop myself 
* Size = Like rice grains, flakes
* Color = Light brownish
* Serving = It came in a big jar, and we just picked them out with our fingers
* Dry, crunchy

319,Amendment to the Telecom Suspension Rules offers little protection against arbitrary and prolonged internet shutdowns #KeepUsOnline,jstve0,india,172,False,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/jstve0/amendment_to_the_telecom_suspension_rules_offers/,16,Policy/Economy,"&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/vmvmlpuwzsy51.png?width=1024&format=png&auto=webp&s=61b1f1a0272062239c32b21fc57232daf177e46c

### Tl;dr

The central government recently amended the Telecom Suspension Rules 2017 to insert Rule 2A which specifies that an internet shutdown order can remain in operation for a maximum period of 15 days. This amendment represents a missed opportunity for wider reform because it fails to incorporate directions issued by the Supreme Court in *Anuradha Bhasin v. Union of India* requiring proactive publication of internet shutdown orders and periodic review by the Review Committee every seven working days. Further, the choice of 15 days as the appropriate length of time for the validity of a suspension order will limit the utility of the recent amendment since most internet shutdowns do not last 15 days. Finally, the amendment was notified without any public consultation and the  government cannot shirk its duty to comprehensively evaluate and reform the legal framework for internet shutdowns by implementing such cosmetic changes.

### What is the legal procedure for ordering internet shutdowns?

On 10 November 2020, the Central Government issued a [**gazette notification**](https://www.livelaw.in/pdf_upload/pdf_upload-384462.pdf) inserting Rule 2A into the Temporary Suspension of Telecom Services (Public Emergency or Public Safety) Rules, 2017. The newly inserted Rule 2A states that *“the suspension order issued by the competent authority under sub-rule (1) shall not be in operation for more than fifteen days.”* Before we analyse the impact of this amendment, we must first understand the legal framework for internet shutdowns in India. Prior to 2017, internet shutdowns were routinely ordered by District Magistrates under Section 144, Code of Criminal Procedure 1973. However, as the Supreme Court has noted in [***Anuradha Bhasin v. Union of India***](https://indiankanoon.org/doc/82461587/), the legal position changed after the Telecom Suspension Rules were notified in 2017 and “*with the promulgation of the Suspension Rules, the States are using the aforesaid Rules to restrict telecom services including access to the internet.”*

Under Rule 2(1) of the [**Telecom Suspension Rules**](https://dot.gov.in/sites/default/files/Suspension%20Rules.pdf), an internet shutdown order should be issued by the Home Secretary of the central or state government. Under Rule 2(6) of the Telecom Suspension Rules, the central or state level Review Committee is required to review internet shutdown orders issued by the Home Secretary within five working days and determine whether the orders demonstrate a ‘public emergency’ or threat to ‘public safety’ under Section 5(2) of the Indian Telegraph Act, 1885. These limited procedural safeguards present in the text of the Telecom Suspension Rules were found to be inadequate by the Supreme Court in *Anuradha Bhasin v. Union of India,* and additional requirements were read into the Rules by the judiciary to perform a gap filling role till the legislature stepped in. In particular, the Supreme Court issued directions requiring (a) proactive publication, (b) time limitation and (c) periodic review of internet shutdown orders.

[\[Extracts from judgement in Anuradha Bhasin v. Union of India\]](https://preview.redd.it/g3e2wyj20ty51.png?width=1136&format=png&auto=webp&s=f3b7f81151f77bcf60f387b596bdd8a896e274f3)

The final position which emerges upon reading Rule 2(6) of the Telecom Suspension Rules with the judgement of the Supreme Court in *Anuradha Bhasin v. Union of India* is that an internet shutdown order must be reviewed by the Review Committee within five working days of its issuance and it should subsequently be reviewed every seven working days from the date of the last review. With insertion of Rule 2A, this would mean that each internet shutdown order should be reviewed only once by the Review Committee during its 15 day life span. For instance, if an internet shutdown order was issued today i.e. 12 November 2020, it could only remain in operation till 26 November 2020 (15 days time limit under Rule 2A). If we assume Saturday and Sunday to be non-working days, the order would have to be reviewed by the Review Committee but only once on 18 November 2020 (first review within five working days under Rule 2(6)) since the second review would be due on 27 November (periodic review after every seven working days of last review as per *Anuradha Bhasin v. Union of India*) by when the order would have expired.

### Amendment represents missed opportunity for wider reform

By limiting the duration of each suspension order to 15 days, the recent amendment provides statutory recognition to the Supreme Court’s direction that internet shutdowns must be temporary only and any indefinite suspension of telecom services is not permissible under the law. However, the amendment fails to incorporate other directions issued by the Supreme Court requiring proactive publication of internet shutdown orders and periodic review by the Review Committee every seven working days from the date of the last review.

**(i) Fails to promote compliance with** ***Anuradha Bhasin v. Union of India***  
As we have [**uncovered** ](https://internetfreedom.in/rti-responses-from-andhra-pradesh-and-gujarat-show-compliance-failure-with-the-anuradha-bhasin-internet-shutdown-decision/)through the RTI Act, compliance by state governments with the judgment of the Supreme Court in *Anuradha Bhasin v. Union of India* remains low. For instance, several state governments have imposed internet shutdowns in 2020 without publishing the underlying orders and they have even refused to provide this information in response to RTI applications. Therefore, the recent amendment represents a missed opportunity to incorporate proactive publication and periodic review as a mandatory duty within the text of the Telecom Suspension Rules which would have increased awareness about these judicially introduced requirements and boosted compliance by state governments.

**(ii) Adopts prolonged internet shutdowns as the baseline**  
The choice of 15 days as the appropriate length of time for the validity of an internet shutdown order will limit the utility of the recent amendment. While regions like Jammu & Kashmir and Darjeeling, West Bengal have experienced very prolonged restrictions, most internet shutdowns in India do not last for 15 days. Therefore, the amendment appears to have been drafted using extreme cases as the baseline and it will not create any additional obligations for government authorities in the vast majority of cases. Even in regions like Jammu & Kashmir, the amendment may lead to a nominal increase in paperwork for government officials who will have to issue orders more frequently to extend the ongoing internet shutdown but it does not prevent the government from routinely issuing boilerplate orders every 15 days.

**(iii) Lack of stakeholder consultation and public participation**  
While reform of the Telecom Suspension Rules is undoubtedly necessary, such an exercise will not be meaningful unless it is preceded by stakeholder engagement and public consultation. On 06 February 2020, the Minister of State for Communications had stated in Rajya Sabha that the central government will review the Telecom Suspension Rules and conduct stakeholder consultation in view of the Supreme Court’s observations in *Anuradha Bhasin v. Union of India.* Earlier this year, IFF had also [**written**](https://internetfreedom.in/cant-drop-the-ball-on-internet-shutdown-reform/) to the Department of Telecommunications and Ministry of Parliamentary Affairs to follow up on this assurance and urged the government to commence the public consultation process for review of the Telecom Suspension Rules. However, till date, this promise has not been fulfilled and Rule 2A was unilaterally inserted into Telecom Suspension Rules without any stakeholder consultation or public participation.

In conclusion, the recent amendments to the Telecom Suspension Rules may be characterized as a bandaid applied on a bullet wound which does little to prevent the patient from bleeding out. The central government cannot shirk its duty to comprehensively evaluate and reform the legal framework for internet shutdowns by implementing such cosmetic changes. Most importantly, any credible legal reform process should involve public consultation and it must also address wider problems such as economic damage caused by internet shutdowns and the ineffectiveness of internet shutdowns at preventing violence.

325,"The Bollywood film ‘Dhoom’ (2004), misinterpreted as an action thriller, is in fact a rigorous allegorical analysis of economic policies, particularly in the Indian context in the early ‘00s.",joloo3,india,239,False,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/joloo3/the_bollywood_film_dhoom_2004_misinterpreted_as/,95,Non-Political,"Spoilers ahead.

Connoisseurs of film are undoubtedly well-aware of *La Nouvelle Vague*, aka, the ‘New Wave’—an experimental movement in filmmaking with its origins in the French cinema of the 1950s, with an emphasis on exploration of personal themes such as existentialism, iconoclasm and absurdism. Although the ‘New Wave’ is considered to have met its chronological end in the late 1960s, to be followed by successive movements like ‘New Hollywood’, ‘Cinema Novo’ and ‘Dogme 95’, the influence of *la nouvelle vague* continues to be keenly felt in the artistic masterpieces of Bollywood production house *YRF*. Under the skillful hand of renowned auteur Aditya Chopra, the studio has produced a lineup of commercially successful arthouse flicks that continue the French filmmaking renaissance of the ‘50s, successfully infusing avant-garde storytelling techniques with high production values and modern Indian themes.  Nowhere is this revolutionary vision more evident than in films like *DDLJ* (a masterpiece in abstract, absurdist storytelling), *Mohabbatein* (a sensitive examination of the taboo topic of attitudes towards adolescent self-gratification), *Kal Ho Naa Ho* (an ambitious adaptation of historian David McCullough’s book 1776), *Jab Tak Hai Jaan* (a religio-philosophical drama that engages in debate upon the tenets of Christianity, Shaivism, and the cultural taboo of Kala Pani) and, of course, the *Dhoom* franchise.

As *YRF*’s most popular franchise, the *Dhoom* series has, with each installment, made great independent strides in cinematic theory and practice. Although—as read above—*YRF* films explore a wide, varying range of topics as a whole, the *Dhoom* franchise focuses exclusively on the examination and discussion of economic and socio-economic matters of policy and practice in the Indian context. Over the course of 3 films, the discourse acquires a rich depth, with the analysis of issues including the economic costs and benefits of national highway construction, the clash between entrepreneurial aspirations and the security of bureaucratic employment, the 2008 economic recession in the BRICS context, and the causes and consequences of non-performing bank loans and a profiling of defaulters of on said loans. Indeed, a first course on Indian economics at any prestigious institution may well be framed around careful viewing and discussion of the *Dhoom* films. In the careful hands of Aditya Chopra and Vijay Krishna Acharya (*Dhoom 1/2/3*, *Tashan*, *Thugs of Hindostan*), each *Dhoom* film achieves a delicate balance between the overt cops-and-robbers heist story and the covert exploration of complex economic schools of thought.

As the 1st film in the franchise, *Dhoom* (2004) establishes the storytelling framework for the films to come, and by itself explores the challenges and opportunities presented by Indian economic policymaking in the early ‘00s. The film features an all-round star-studded cast, with support from Honorary Roadie & *Stardust Awards* nominee Esha Deol, *Star’s Sabsey Award* winner Rimi Sen, and *Indian Telly Award* nominee Arav Chowdharry. At the film’s helm are *Lions Club Award* winner John Abraham, *Sansui Award* winner Abhishek Bachchan, and *Emmy* nominee Uday Chopra. Series regulars Bachchan and Chopra play Jai and Ali respectively, Jai being a policeman and Ali a small-time mechanic with a penchant for fast bikes and disinterested women. Abraham essays the villainous role of Kabir, part-time restaurant waiter and part-time leader of a gang of biker thieves. 

The film begins with a series of daring heists pulled off by Kabir’s gang, relying on their high-speed bikes to orchestrate sudden thefts and promptly escape the scene soon after. Their exploits catch the eye of Jai, a lifetime appointee to the post of Assistant Commissioner of Police. Jai, however, finds himself out of his depth and through a series of accidents, makes the acquaintance of Ali, a mildly-seedy mechanic and bike racer. Initially reluctant to be associated with law enforcement, Ali is eventually induced to join Jai’s cause and attempt to chase down Kabir and his merry band of men. *Dhoom* is slow and deliberate in its setup, and the film’s early minutes are heavy on subtext and detail, therefore, it is essential to take in the plot in small increments, so as to be thorough with one’s analysis. 

In an allegorical sense, Jai, as a police officer, represents bureaucratic authority and the security, comforts and powers of government employment. Abraham’s Kabir, as a thief, is a *laissez-faire* capitalist, relying on his material advantage in the form of fast bikes and his manpower advantage in the form of skilled bikers to partake in a series of one-sided transactions with economic entities such as banks and government funds. In this sense, the act of robbery in *Dhoom* is merely a transaction between two private parties wherein one side gains an unfair amount at the other’s expense, absent external interventionism. In addition to being a free-market advocate, Kabir is also an employee at a pizza parlour, which seems to be the film’s attempt at exploring both the growing role of the service economy as a share of India’s Gross Domestic Product (GDP), and the amorphous nature of employment within the modern ‘gig’ economy. Caught between the competing ideas of state-control and free capitalism, Chopra’s Ali is a stand-in for the directionless youth, lured by the safety and dignity of a government job, whilst simultaneously seduced by the potential for greater wealth presented by free-market capitalism. The film’s plot is overt in this depiction, with Ali simultaneously fearful of Jai’s authority, yet desirous of wielding said authority as an employed policeman. Furthermore, in an action sequence set in Mumbai’s Chor Bazaar—a flea market specializing in illegally-hawked goods—Jai and Ali get into a fight with goons in the market, and are forced to make a hasty escape after being outnumbered. Ali bringing Jai to the market illustrates his ties to the informal, underground economy—a large, undocumented component of the Indian economy—and Jai’s subsequent fleeing the scene highlights the failed outcome of government attempts to regulate this grey economy by force and bluster. 

Initially at a loss for clues, Jai is eventually able to deduce that Kabir’s bikers arrange their heists in close proximity to highways, providing as the highways do quick getaways after. This is no doubt an allusion to the economic importance of the National Highways Authority of India’s flagship ‘Golden Quadrilateral’ national highway construction project. Kabir, the raw capitalist, is empowered in his capitalistic pursuits by the government’s infrastructure investments, and John Abraham’s moody expression throughout the film is in no small part perhaps due to the discontentment within Kabir’s mind about his enterprise’s dependence on resources provided by the state. Having deduced Kabir’s MO, Jai and Ali attempt to catch him in the act. However, Kabir and his gang appear to have substantially faster bikes than Jai and Ali, which is undoubtedly an allusion to the government’s perceived ineptitude and inability to generally compete with private enterprise. Left chafing and chasing the dust, Jai catches a lucky break when an overconfident Kabir offers him a clue about his upcoming crime, with the catch being that if Jai fails to avert it, he must recuse himself from the case and leave Kabir to his entrepreneurial pursuits. Kabir, the staunch capitalist, is here hinting at the idea of termination clauses in Public-Private Partnerships (PPPs), agreements between enterprises and governments for mutual benefit. Whilst the government naturally retains the right to sever the partnership at any point, Kabir clearly believes that he, as the private party, is also entitled to terminate the contract should the government, aka Jai, default on the agreed-upon terms. Formally known as the ‘Authority Default’ concept, Dhoom represents this idea in the form of a simple, easy to understand challenge between Jai and Kabir. 

Even as this layered conflict plays out between Jai and Kabir, Ali is enamoured by the mysterious ‘Dilbara’ (Esha Deol). Little is known about Dilbara, however, like other characters in the film, it may be reasonably assumed than she is also an allegorical depiction of an economic concept. Ali’s infatuation with her suggests that she is perhaps intended to be portrayed as a vague, undefined avenue of aspirational employment. Furthermore, the fact that she (as is later revealed) is in fact a part of Kabir’s gang, yet also harbours feelings for Ali, leads one to conclude that Dilbara represents a form of compromise between *dirigisme*, aka restrictive state-controlled economy, and *laissez-faire* anarcho-capitalism. The filmmakers leave the specifics of this compromise vague, however, Dilbara’s skimpy outfits perhaps represent the scantiness of opportunities presented by this nebulous alternative. 

Returning to the main plot, Jai, despite being forewarned, fails to foil Kabir’s next robbery, despite being able to take down one of his gang in the process. Left short of a gang member, Kabir attempts to recruit Ali, left sidelined by Jai following their failure to catch Kabir. The jilted Ali readily embraces Kabir’s neoliberal worldview and the duo jet off to Goa, where Kabir has his eyes set on one final score from a casino. Subtextually, the casino and gambling in general represent what is in Kabir’s eyes an essential component of his brand of capitalism—rampant speculation and volatility that may be manipulated to one’s benefit. There may also be an addition reference to British academic Susan Strange’s seminal 1986 work *Casino Capitalism*, a critique of unregulated banking and financial systems. However, Kabir is more likely than not to be derisive of such thoughts, and therefore, if this reference was intended, it may merely be made to indicate the filmmakers’ complete mastery over both Keynesian and Austrian schools of economic thought.

The importance of dance numbers in *YRF* films cannot be overstated. Even as Bollywood music gravitates towards being little more than catchy jingles designed to elicit maximum publicity, the music and dance numbers in *YRF* films complement the plot perfectly, serving to both entertain and narrate. *Dhoom* is no exception to this tradition of excellence. On the eve of Kabir’s final heist, an inebriated Jai shows up at the casino, claiming to have left police employment and moved on. Kabir, however, is rightly suspicious, given as Jai is still a cop, and is merely attempting to lure Kabir into a false sense of comfort as a prelude to catching him in the act. This Jai accomplishes by putting on a song-and-dance in front of Kabir to convince him of his abandonment of state-sponsored socialism and his embrace of Kabir’s unrestrained capitalism. The song is entitled ‘Salamee’, a clever homophone of ‘salami’, a sausage that consists primary of beef. The consumption of beef was, in a landmark 2005 Supreme Court judgement, forbidden on grounds on anti cow-slaughter laws. Kabir, as an opponent of government intervention, would likely have been opposed to the idea of such a restriction being imposed upon him. Therefore, to show his solidarity to the cause, Jai takes to the stage in front of Kabir and sways to the refrain of *“Naye kal ko aao kare, hum karein, karein/Salami, salami, salami/Kar le salami…”*.

The subterfuge is apparently successful, and a placated Kabir is lulled into a false sense of security by Jai’s reinforcement of his worldview. However, as mentioned, Jai’s conversion is little more than a ruse, and a hoodwinked Kabir is successfully caught in the act by Jai and Ali, who is revealed to have been Jai’s mole all along. The ever-slippery Kabir, however, weasels his way out of Jai’s clutches, and flees with his loot. Although *Dhoom 3* would better address the phenomenon of loan defaulters taking flight from the verge of captivity, *Dhoom* too takes a cursory look at the occurrence, although Kabir does not quite embody a loan defaulter. He is merely the free-market capitalist, the robber baron caught flouting regulations and fleeing from the consequences of government intervention. A long chase sequence ensues, with Kabir fleeing but ultimately cornered by Jai and Ali at the precipice of a sea-facing cliff. Facing a choice between certain captivity and death, Kabir chooses to fly off the cliff with the last of his loot. In a literal sense, Kabir merely dies by falling off the cliff into the sea. In a figurative sense, faced with the prospect of his enterprise being forced to comply with ungainly regulations, Kabir chooses instead to offshore his business, and make for better waters, thus bringing his character arc to a natural and satisfying conclusion. A frustrated Jai bemoans his end, representing the government’s exasperation at ultimately failing to bring a rogue enterprise to heel. Ali, having seen his capitalistic expectations dive off a cliff with Kabir, chooses in the film’s final shot, to finally pursue the path to safe, steady, state-sponsored employment after all, asking Jai if he finally is a bona-fide police officer, as the film fades to black. 

The topical nature of *Dhoom* is a cause for admiration, even a decade and a half after its release. The film successfully ties together strands of economic and socio-economic thought from its time—the ‘Golden Quadrilateral’ project received a major fillip in the first years of the new millennium, the service sector encountered a boom around the same time, as did the contribution of outsourcing to employment and economic growth. The rise of men like Kabir is perfectly timed in the post-License Raj years, as the country embraced capitalism over state socialism. Yet, the lure of stable, ‘safe’ government employment holds true, and powers men like Jai and seduces men like Ali. Dilbara’s unknown fate at the end of the film—left waiting for Ali by the side of a road—is representative of the uncertain outcomes of economic models with time. On a meta note, the *Dhoom* franchise’s casting of Abhishek Bachchan and Uday Chopra in every film is a nod to the ‘Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Act’ of 2005, a flagship government initiative that guarantees employment for a certain number of days out of the year, in the form of unskilled labour.

In summation, *Dhoom* rightly deserves its place as a seminal film in the annals of both *YRF* and Indian cinema. In its own right, it is a bold, experimental film that marries erudition to entertainment. It is also the progenitor of its celebrated franchise, providing the springboard from which future films would explore similar issues in an equally deft and precise fashion. To *YRF*, the *Dhoom* franchise, and Indian cinema, the film *Dhoom* is nothing short of a bottle of nitrous oxide, that when attached to a bike, propels it into the stratosphere.","Wtf is this nonsense, it's a Bollywood money making flick which also happens to be a good movie to watch.

I recently visited India during this lockdown and met up with a friend. We got into a discussion about how things were going and he seemed qute ecstatic about his work-life right now.

He works full time for a SaaS company and has been working from home during the lockdown.

To make use of the extra time, he took up another full time job to work on during the night. 

- The day job pays PF and deducts TDS like a regular full time employer with all other benefits
- The night one doesn't do PF or TDS or anything else

Right now he's planning to declare income from second job as freelance income.

But I was concerned since the contracts mention that the employee isn't allowed to work with any other organization in any capacity.

Do you have any suggestions on what would be the best path?","What your friend did by taking on another job is why companies are hesitant to allow more remote work. It poisons the pool for everyone else, including disabled people who are unable to commute to a workplace but can do the job remotely. This also leads to companies concentrating jobs in metros thus raising real estate prices which makes it harder for everyone else to afford housing.

My family's problems started long before the pandemic. I had to drop out of high school because of my family's severe financial problems and the deterioration of my own mental health.

Now my father's money is running out and in December he will no longer be able to pay the rent of the place we're living in right now. After that we will have to live in the streets like beggars since we do not own any property of our own, in Guwahati or in any village.

I'm a guy who has the ability and the smartness to do any decent job, I just haven't passed my 10th grade(I am still trying to pass it, it's only because of my mental struggles I fail). I can't get a job because I don't have any educational qualifications. So if anybody can offer me any job in any city so that I can keep surviving, I will be forever grateful. I'm begging you all. Help me. I do not want to live on the street and starve to death. I can shine if given the opportunity.

Please help me.

I will discuss with them and start the crowdfunding. I will of course explore the other options as well since I don't want to put all my eggs in one basket and regret it later.

I've been gathering components for building a new video editing rig, and was hoping to put Ryzen 5000 series into my B550 motherboard.

But unfortunately my [motherboard](https://www.asrock.com/mb/AMD/B550M%20Steel%20Legend/index.asp) came with AGESA AM4 v2 bios 1.0.0.2.

Requirement:

Need someone to lend me a Ryzen 3000 processor (Zen2) for just one day, to perform a BIOS update. Will be handled with the utmost care. Will pick up if local, or pay for courier if nearby city. Will also pay reasonably for borrowing the processor.

The issue is:

I need to update the BIOS on my motherboard to AGESA AM4 v2 1.0.8.0 at least to be able to boot into the BIOS with a Ryzen 5000 chip, and to update it to AGESA AM4 v2 1.1.0.0 to be able to boot into the OS.

The BIOS cannot be updated without a supported chip (Ryzen 3000), and I don't have a Ryzen 3000 chip nor the budget (since I'm already going for Ryzen 5000). I cannot update the BIOS with a Ryzen 5000 chip which I will be buying.

I'm a resident of Bangalore, but courier options are welcome.

### Tl;dr

IFF’s impleadment application has been tagged by the Madras High Court with a PIL seeking regulation of video streaming and video hosting platforms. In the impleadment application, we have tried to provide a bigger picture of the state of OTT regulation in India and cautioned against judicial intervention at this stage because it is a complex and technical issue best addressed through legislative and policy making processes involving extensive stakeholder consultation.

### Background

On 05 August 2020, the Madras High Court issued notice in a PIL filed by a lawyer seeking regulation of content available on video streaming platforms (which host curated and commissioned content. Eg. Netflix) and video hosting platforms (which host user generated content. Eg. YouTube). The PIL alleges that these platforms are disseminating content which is abusive, obscene, adulterous and hurts religious sentiments. To address this problem, the PIL seeks establishment of a censor board to pre-screen online videos and it also seeks restrictions on the creation of YouTube accounts.

This PIL is one of several petitions filed before different High Courts across the country seeking regulation of OTT platforms. Fortunately, so far, the High Courts of Delhi, Bombay and Karnataka have declined to frame regulations for OTT platforms. However, in November 2020, the Ministry of Information & Broadcasting (MIB) [**informed**](https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/media/entertainment/ib-ministry-to-seek-transfer-of-all-ott-related-cases-to-sc/articleshow/79421185.cms?from=mdr) the Punjab & Haryana High Court that over 23 OTT regulation cases were pending before different High Courts and a transfer petition would soon be filed before the Supreme Court. Therefore, with proliferation of such PILs, it is likely that cases relating to regulation of OTT platforms will be consolidated and transferred to the Supreme Court in the near future.

### Regulatory Attempts

Regulation of OTT platforms has become a hot button issue in the past few years, and major industry players have tried to adopt a self-regulatory model which comes with its own set of problems. We had previously [**written**](https://internetfreedom.in/online-video-streaming-and-tv-are-not-the-same-so-why-is-the-iamai-trying-to-make-it-so/) to the Internet and Mobile Association of India (IAMAI) and cautioned against importing the model of television censorship into the online streaming space because a self-regulatory code which was privately devised by a handful of established players would harm innovation, disadvantage smaller new players and restrict viewer choice. In our follow up representation, we also [**warned**](https://internetfreedom.in/read-our-follow-up-letter-to-justice-a-p-shah-on-self-censorship-by-hotstar-and-the-iamais-self-regulation-code/) about the creation of a Digital Content Complaint Council which could lead to overbroad and carterlized censorship.

More recently, in November 2020, the Cabinet Secretariat issued a notification stating that digital and online media including audiovisual programmes made available by online content providers falls within the jurisdiction of the MIB. This notification was issued under the Government of India (Allocation of Business) Rules, 1961 and we have previously [**explained**](https://internetfreedom.in/read-our-follow-up-letter-to-justice-a-p-shah-on-self-censorship-by-hotstar-and-the-iamais-self-regulation-code/) why this notification by itself cannot justify licensing or content certification of OTT platforms unless supported by legislation enacted by Parliament. However, issuance of the notification has led to understandable nervousness about potential government regulation of OTT platforms which is reminiscent of the control exercised by MIB over films, television and radio.

### Highlights of the Impleadment Application

IFF’s impleadment application was tagged with the PIL by the Madras High Court on 10 December 2020 and we expect the matter to be listed again after the winter break. We are extremely grateful to the legal team comprising Suhrith Parathasarathy and Surasika Parathasarathy for representing IFF before the Madras High Court in this case.

In the impleadment application, we have tried to provide a bigger picture of the state of OTT regulation in India and cautioned against judicial intervention at this stage for the following reasons.

First, while considering the need for additional regulation, we must be wary of drawing a false equivalence between online video hosting/streaming platforms and television and film broadcasting. Heavy handed regulation which is applicable to traditional mediums may not be necessary for the internet because of its unique technical features and emphasis on private viewing experiences. Adopting a one size fits all approach and imposing pre-certification requirements on these online platforms would destroy their ability to create unconventional, thought-provoking and innovative content.

Second, the fundamental right to freedom of speech and expression guaranteed under Article 19(1)(a) can be reasonably restricted in accordance with Article 19(2) only if there is a statute, rule or regulation. Therefore, Article 19(2) of the Constitution does not permit restrictions on online video hosting/streaming platforms in the absence of a legislation.

Third, there are a large number of remedies already available under the Indian Penal Code, 1860 and the Information Technology Act, 2000 to tackle illegal content shared on the internet. Specifically, under Section 79 of the IT Act, online video hosting platforms which host user-generated content already have an obligation to take down unlawful content after receiving actual knowledge of the same through a court order or a notification from an appropriate government agency. Similarly, video streaming platforms which host curated and commissioned content can be held liable for existing offences under the IT Act which prohibit electronic publication of obscene or sexually explicit content.

Any further regulation would be necessary only if there is a failure of market mechanisms. Moreover, this type of regulation should be formulated through the legislative process because extensive study and stakeholder consultation will be required due to the dynamic and technical nature of the online video hosting/streaming industry.

I just wanted to know if there is any way through which I can claim the warranty (valid till Sep 2021) here in India so that the repairing charges can be averted. Or will I have to ship it to China for the repairs.,Only transferable to India if you purchased Dell's onsite warranty policy. It's called Premium Care or something. ,2020-11-30 21:19:39

439,[NP]Life of a Bihari in Maharshtra. It's not what it looks like.,8ybojq,india,176,False,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/8ybojq/nplife_of_a_bihari_in_maharshtra_its_not_what_it/,96,Unverified,"So quite recently this incident happened to a friend of mine who runs a Pan-Cigerette shop. Yeah, I have friends from all walks of life and job, I also recently attended my watchman's daughters Birthday and gave her an expensive teddy bear. I believe that even a cobbler deserves to be called Sir or Sahab by Upper class Rich men. Anyways, so during closing time of his shop in his area, a friend of his was involved in a brawl with a OLA cabbie. I don't know the exact issue so didn't my panwala friend, but he as a good samaritan and a friend of that other guy , tried to stop the fight which had escalated quickly. Few minutes later, that other guy lost his turd mind completely and hit that cabbie with a stone and the cabbie fell flat bleeding a little. Dunno how the cops came there but I think it was their job to patrol and I'm glad they did. But what they did was not quite correct. They didn't hear my Panwala friend's version that he was not involved in that stone bashing but the other guy was. He was only there to stop the argument and the fight which he did initially, like a good samaritan. But cops didn't hear it at all and also took him to the police station along with the perpetrator who was quite all the time after he bashed the cabbie with stone.

My Panwala friend tried his best to convince them that he was not involved at all and to check even the CCTV camera of his own shop if they want his proof. But cops were determined to make him co-accused just because he was a witness and not a perpetrator. Cuz he run a panshop which is well flourishing and makes good money out of it. And he has dark complexion and is from Bihar. Yes, this incident is from Maharashtra and it's a known factor how Marathi looks down at Biharis. Cops of Maharashtra are the worst in terms of Biharis. So just because he was that, cop assumed he might be a criminal and because he is Bhaiyya.

Now here comes the best part, the Incident happened 2 nights ago, and cops put him in custody for 24 hours. Without filing an FIR which should have been the case as it looked like a half murder case, the victim was injured with little blood on his face, he was taken care of after medical assistance. Just few stitches. Thank God. And he kept telling the cops that my panwala friend was not the one who did this, he was just there to stop the fight even though he was friend of the guy he was fighting with. Cops didn't care, they were in another trance it seemed. They told him in front of my panwala friend (and this is the reason for my post) that the panwala guy is a Bhaiyya(Bihari) and by looking at his face he looks like a murderer, he must have murdered somebody in Bihar and came here to work. We dealt with so many Biharis who are criminals in Mumbai. So he must be one of them. 

And after that the Ola Cabbie(victim) was let go. The guy who threw the stone on that ola cabbie remained silent the whole time, because he was a Marathi man and in his sinister mind wanted that Bihari (my friend panwala) to take all the blame. He also said he has a support of some local goon so he did threw that stone just because he was drunk and he wanted to. So the cop didn't question him at all. Their main target became my Bihari panwala friend. Because he was a Low caste Bihari Bhaiyya so he is a natural born criminal. It's on his face according to the Marathi group of cops.

So after 24 hour of remand, he was asked to pay 25k otherwise FIR will be registered against both. Ofcourse the FIR will be made also against the perpetrator, but they didn't ask for any amount to him. Only to my Bihari friend. He was all beaten with a leather strap just because he was arguing to the cops that he was innocent. Marathi cops said "" Eh Motherfucking Bhaiyya, lower your voice now, ir we will fuck your ass the whole night."" Exact words in marathi. So my friend took the beating and kept quite. The night went in jail and after 24 hours, he was able to call his family and told them to arrange 25k on the spot. Ofcourse since they didn't belong to 1 lac per month family, they had like 10k with them. I was called and I gave the rest of the amount. And he was let go, without having any case on him since no FIR was filed.

Now here is the funny thing, Cops fear the most to file an FIR. It is like a Holy scripture for them cuz they know they cannot be fictitious while making it. All the statements have to be mentioned and with every minute detail. And inspite of my Panwala friend's statement that he was not the one who threw stone, the victim said my Panwala friend was not involved, the marathi guy who threw stone was silent, it all had to be mentioned in the FIR. Get it guys? The cops wanted to make money out of the situation from a Bihari and yes they did, and they let the Marathi guy go scot free. Yes they did. 

Now I dunno if me as a Marathi man should feel disgusted or feel proud of being a Marathi manoos, I dunno. Cuz an always grew up thinking we all are Indians and every person should be respected and be treated fairly. That's what it's called being a true commuting Maharashtrian Mumbaikar. But this Incident has made me hate the so called Marathi pride. ","Aab itna FIR ka gyan baat rahe ho yaha pe, to police ko paise kyon diye? gaand me dum hota to cops ko vahi pe expose kar sakta tha tu. 

In a way you helped those cops close the deal. ",2018-07-13 01:13:06

Now there are barely any companies hiring for freshers and my college doesn't give a shit about students who are still unplaced. My confidence is way low compared to last year that now I stutter in interviews too much that I myself sometimes don't understand what I'm about to say next. I forget basic stuff in interviews and sometimes I feel to punch the screen or pull the wire of the broadband.

I don't have much to offer on my resume as I didn't have any interest in coding from school times but I had to opt for Btech  because my parents were concerned that the other courses won't have any good job. I tried learning python and django but had to quit midway because I didn't find any interest doing it.

 I just managed to grab technical internship from a company and got to learn some stuff about AWS and Rest API. But they don't ask anything about it and only ask about other ratta stuff.

I don't know what to study, what to do in life, which kind of job I want.

Please help me or else I'll go deep in depression sittng idle in home meanwhile my friends who got placed from their college brag about their office stories and try to taunt me indirectly.

Please understand that this is a GIMMICK. It means NOTHING.

ASCI has been giving such notices to Byjus since 2016. What changed?

18 April 2018: MediaNama:  [ASCI calls out Byju’s, Voot, and Mobikwik for misleading ads](https://www.medianama.com/2018/04/223-asci-calls-out-byjus-voot-app-and-mobikwik-for-misleading-ads/)

19 Oct 2016: MediaNama: [ASCI calls out BYJU's Learning for false advertisements.](https://www.medianama.com/2016/10/223-asci-false-advertising-july2016/)

For so many years Byjus is doing unethical and false advertisements. ASCI keeps 'asking' them to remove those ads.

* Where is the punishment?
* Who were the people responsible for those false ads? They are still working in Byjus and WhiteHatJr. Actually, **Byju Raveendran and Karan Bajaj themselves are fully responsible for these false ads**. Fire the ones who dared LYING to kids.
* Why didn't ASCI tweet about these recent 5 ads removed from WhiteHatJr's collection of false ads?
* These ads were in circulation for 1.5 years. Why did ASCI wait for so many of us to make videos and posts after posts for them to take any action?
* Why only 5 ads, what about the rest of the dozens of false ads?
* Why isn't Google India and YouTube India taking ANY action against WhiteHatJr for misusing their logos?

My request to ASCI, start a tweeter threat and tag WhiteHatJr into it. And let's discuss there what all ads are false and ask WhiteHatJr to fire those who are directly responsible for making those ads.

For EVERY SINGLE false ad, there must be some accountability.

WhiteHatJR and Byjus, you are caught red-handed, can't just move on just like that. You WILL have to answer each and every concern raised by all of us directly on some platform. Enough of 'YourStory' drama.

Please guys support my tweets and LinkedIn posts. We can't just let these SCAMMERS and LIARS escape just like that. Let's set a big example here, else some time from now, where you and me both get tired, these EdTechs will again start doing this same BS.

My original plan was to crack CAT but couldn't clear it. Tried 2 times but to no avail. 

Now 2 years have passed and I've done nothing basically (although I did brush up some coding here and there, but nothing on paper) .

I have just started coding again, started with cs50 on edx but still feel bad considering I am 24 and still learning the basics. and god knows how would I explain that 2 year gap.

I am also somewhat depressed as my friends are working on 10 lpa+ jobs whilst I'm still at at big 0.

If that helps I have 80% in 10th & 12th, and 7.3 CGPA in my grad. 

Looking for some advice as how to follow through so that I could end up with a decent job.

I am in deep regret, & I am ready to work my ass off. I really want to ctach up to my classmates, even better them but I don't know how. 

Any help is appreciated. Also Is it a good idea to cover it up with a fake startup? I mean I could create a website and show it as my 2 year work? Can they catch me? If not, Any other advice? 

Should I go freelancing ot hunt for job, I live in Indore if it may help.

My dream is to get into some big product based company. I am willing to do any amount of work for that.

Thanks for listening folks. If anyone had a similar phase let me know.

Edit : I think people mistook me for not liking coding. I'd like to clarify that I didn't ever dug up coding, I was naive so didn't knew much, was lazy so didn't tried much either. Now that I've started learning programming seriously, I love it.

So, please don't think I am doing coding because I'm desperate. I actually want to do it. My concerns are how to cover up my 2 year gap and get back on track.

As a non-vegetarian, I often wonder what foreign meat dishes are like. But then most of the people I've talked with, who've had foods of different countries, say they are bland and not really that good, and that I being a spice lover would definitely be disappointed.

I used to dream about sushi but my uncle told me it's basically just raw fish wrapped in rice or something. 

So, my question is, what are some foreign meat dishes that you, as an Indian, actually liked and you think they would be well received by Indian meat eaters in general, or that they would be popular dishes in India.

Notice how he wants his kids to pursue whatever they want and excel in it, but is hellbent on shoving coding (in a very shitty manner) down the next generation of India's kids. He keeps posting about yoga and zen and the likes but has complete disregard for the mental harm he is causing to potentially millions in this country. I escaped the shitty ""coaching classes"" culture of India but found that in the last 4-5 years, its kinda becoming the same for interviews in the tech sector (I am looking at you, LeetCode and HackerRank). But at least thats aimed at adults ranging from 18 to retirement.  
  
If shitty ed-tech companies like Byju's and WhiteHat Jr succeed, we are ensuring the doom of young children in India (as young as 6) to the rat race that will eventually lead to more common occurrences of depression and suicide.  
  
More power to you /u/pooniahigh  
  
This is Arindam Chaudhuri and IIPM all over again, except that its a much bigger monster backed by big VC money. God bless Maheshwar Peri and others who took down IIPM. It's time we take down this next generation of scam that has a much bigger influence on our society (we can't let this coaching culture become the norm as soon as kids get out of kindergarten!)  
  
PS: SRK has endorsed IIPM in the past. Fair and Handsome too. He is now endorsing Byjus. Guess he likes peddling things that harm society in general.

School at 7:30 am.  
Come back home at 1:30 pm  
Have lunch while watching Cartoon Network (Toonami was awesome. Swat Kats and Dexter's Laboratory were my favorites). Do homework.  
Play box cricket (or on a ground if there is some space) from 5:30 pm to 8:00 pm  
Dinner, some TV (Surabhi, Shriman Shrimati, Kaun Banega Crorepati in later years?) and then bed (or any last minute homework).  
  
Notice that except for school and homework, there was a lot of time to enjoy, play and live life.

My cousin and my maternal uncle runs a milk parlour and pan stand in Tonk phatak, Jaipur.

It's on the most busiest roads in Jaipur, Tonk road which was deserted due to bandh. Yesterday in the early morning my cousin went to the shop to store the milk which is delivered daily.

He had no intention of opening the shop as the newspapers said there would be a curfew nationwide due to SC/ST protest. Whilst, doing some cleaning around the shop a riot group of over 150 **unemployed** men showed up and started looting the shop and destroying milk crates along some garbage cans.

Like every common man my cousin stopped them from doing so in order to save his livelihood.

In retaliation they pelted him with rocks mercilessly.

He caught a huge rock on his head and knee. Immediately suffering a concussion and scrapped knee he fell down.

Suddenly a brave old woman came to his rescue and shouted at the hoodlums which coerced them into leaving.

My cousin was then helped up by her and some neighboring shop owners provided him with first aid.

At the end, I just want to say that this riot didn't solve any purpose to the cause these castes were protesting for. This just made the situation a lot worse fir then in upcoming future.

**Tl;dr**- My cousin got pelted with stones by Sc/St rioters and got his shop partially destroyed.",No education and unemployment. Fucking killing this nation. No good healthcare too.  ,2018-04-03 11:09:50

So my mom and I have had enough of my emotionally, verbally and sometimes physically abusive father, and we are planning on leaving the house. But we don't want any confrontation with him.

He has financially, emotionally and verbally abused my mother over the past 25+ years at least (I am 25). Forcing her to pay (by force, i mean FORCE like ""give it to me or else"" kind of situation) to buy properties and stuff. He has threatened to harm us both so many times that I can't even count any more. He has attacked her physically (slapped) a few times, but there weren't any bruises or any such thing.

And the worst part is, the fool cries later and starts blaming us for ""not paying attention to him"", saying he's going to commit suicide because of how much \*we\* have troubled him.

He has also threatened to hurt other family members and stuff, and honestly we are sick of it.

We are still in the house at the moment, and are not able to quite figure out how to go about things.

So I want to know two things:

Are we in any real danger of being attacked or killed or something here?What would be the best way to leave? (With minimum confrontation, and maximum safety)

Our landlord is a lady who brought us into their home as she considered my mother to be an elder sister to her. They lived upstairs, we lived in ground floor.

The rent was decided to be 14,000 INR per month. We happily paid each month on time. Then lockdown hit us and our source of income was lost to us. We couldn't make rent for April after which the landlord and us had a verbal agreement that we will pay around 10,000 per month due to this pandemic situation. 

They kept haggling us on a day to day basis for rent, even before date of payment. We did give them money regularly even by selling our things such as refrigerator and all. Rent was regularly made by us each month..

Then month of July came and we paid around 5,000 on 10th July and promised another 5,000 on 25th. They agreed but still kept haggling us everyday and soon, arguments and fights started to happen. They would come to our place and sit for hours, and would also call us at midnight. . On the 23rd, they shut down our water supply (under the pretext that the motor was faulty and they needed 800 rupees for repairs) and demanded us to vacate their premises. 

We said that we have nowhere to go, and paid them another 1,000 for repairs of the motor after borrowing from a good Samaritan.. However, they did not restore our water supply and started fighting us. 

Their maid would call us names, would assassinate our character, disrespect us and whatnot. Same for the landlady.. 

We stopped payments to them as they refused to reinstate our water supply and on the 12th of August, they brought a big man to our doorstep who demanded to know the date that we will give them the possession. My mother said that we are looking for a place but again, the landlady started fighting and so did her brother as well as their maid.. 

And yesterday they pasted a legal notice on our door that we had to pay them 70,000 in arrears for rent and 5,500 for the cost of the notice. If we stay in the premises after midnight of 12th of August (this notice itself was served at midnight of 13th August) , it would be deemed illegal trespassing and would attract a fine of 1,000 per day.

We have paid for rent with sweat and blood and now they are claiming that we never paid at all and we don't have water in our house. What sort of legal recourse do we have? We can't afford expensive lawyer fees.. Advise will be very appreciated..🙏

Update : Thank you very much for your kind responses people of r/India. You all will be glad to know that we have talked with our landlord this morning and after a lot of request have got some time to vacate the place. By 25th of August in all probability. 

We are looking for a cheap place, my sisters have helped me with some money and my son (who is a 12th class topper currently studying BA Hons in Hindu college. Yes, I'm a proud boastful mother 😊) has even been offered a very good job by one of the kind patrons on this site. This means a lot and I wish the best to you wonderful people. 

Some people are expressing skepticism because we do not have a bank account and that our post is fake. If you need proof, please DM me your email and I will send you pictures of the legal notice in question pasted on our door and the rent agreement as well as the picture of the empty space where our water motor used to be. About account,  We do have a subsidy account (for gas subsidy)  that is almost useless because my ex husband deals with us in cash. It used to be around  a comfortable 24,000-28,000 per month before lockdown when his business was still going forward.. (guzaara bhatta/child support as one would say). There is no need to make joke with people online with sob stories. This can be verified by a Delhi moderator, as one person said. 

One person had also said that crowdfunding posts like mine should be banned and that begging shouldn't be allowed.. This was not very kind but I would kindly request you to please read my original post again and tag the line where I've mentioned that I need monetary help from anyone.  I only asked for some advise on how to approach this and I have already refused money from a lot of kind people and will continue to do so, as there are needier people out there. Sookhi roti and bread was all my son ate yesterday but we choose not to seek crowdfunding. 

I would once again like to thank you so much for your kind words and support this means a lot to our family and your support is something I will remember my entire life. I am also glad that the landlord were kind enough to give us some time to leave without any legal action. I have updated this in my original post as well.

But what followed after was a state-sponsored genocide against innocent Sikhs. The sheer level of brutality that was exercised by the perpetrators, most of the whom belonged to the ruling Indian National Congress is something that cannot be described. Sikhs were burnt alive, our women were raped, Gurudwaras were destroyed and desecrated, hundreds became orphans that day. Congress workers were given money and booze for every murder they committed. That day, the Indian Government showed its true colours. Electoral Lists were also used to identify the victims and the Delhi Police openly let the pogroms happen. 

In total, more than 3000 Sikhs were killed (unofficial numbers are even higher) and the massacres happened not only in Delhi, but all across India.

However, there is something that isn't talked about. Majority of the perpetrators are still alive. They never got any time in prison. They are still roaming freely, you never know the man sitting across your table in a restaurant might have participated in the genocide. The Government even celebrated and awarded many of them. Leaders became MP's, MLA's and Rajiv Gandhi had the audacity to mock the victims when he openly tried to justify the genocide with his infamous "" when a big tree falls the earth shakes"".

People still don't know about how the judiciary was misused to provide protection to the perpetrators. We haven't received justice 36 years later. Sajjan Kumar going to jail after 34 years is a JOKE and he is just 1 guy. We don't deserve this, in fact, nobody deserves such mistreatment. People still don't know about the Ranganath Misra Commission appointed by the Congress which instead of providing justice to the victims completely exonerated (absolved) Congressmen from their brutal acts. The Commission outright rejected the majority of the affidavits filed by the victims as well as witnesses. It's no surprise for me that Mr. Misra later on became a Rajya Sabha MP for Congress.

36 years and no one wants to talk about us, not even the current Indian Government. People didn't support the Sikhs after the genocide. They voted the perpetrators back into the power and completely stereotyped my community, we became a bunch of 'drunk jokers' for the rest of the country, who would shamelessly be made fun of. Nobody talks about the victims, NOBODY.

We are all alone. Even in 2020, witnesses still receive threats and H.S Phoolka, a Sikh Lawyer who has fought for justice all alone still receives death threats. We don't see mass rallies in support of the victims, calls for justice and accountability of our Governments. My Grandpa was in Delhi that day for work. He was thankfully protected by the Hotel Manager, who kept him hidden for 2 days. My Grandma still remembers about how much she was crying because she didn't know whether he was alive or not. He ultimately survived and discreetly returned back to Punjab, 3 days later. 

The lack of humanity shown towards Genocide Victims in this country is absolutely appalling. We Sikhs haven't forgotten what happened to us but we need others to support us and to talk about the lack of justice. We can do this by educating people about the Genocide. Enough is enough !!

561,How abolition of APMC fared in Bihar — A Review,k99tou,india,33,False,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/k99tou/how_abolition_of_apmc_fared_in_bihar_a_review/,9,Policy/Economy,"Amidst all the protest and opposition to the new farm laws, Bihar has become a center of focus. This is because of one of the three farm laws in discussion, the Farmers' Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Act, 2020, more commonly known as the APMC Amendment Act. Interestingly, Bihar had abolished the APMC Act in 2006. So what was the outcome?

It has been bad, to put it in one word. Recently published news report of the paddy farmers in Bihar reveals that the farmers are receiving anywhere between ₹900 to ₹1200 per quintal for their produce. This is about half of the MSP (minimum support price) fixed by the center, i.e. ₹1868. MSP relates to the cost of produce, which means farmers in Bihar are not even able to realize the amount they invested to produce the crop. Just a few months ago, farmers and activists in Bihar were sitting on an agitation for MSP on maize, went to the court, but to no avail.

Abolition of APMC has removed the market stabilising force with which price can be controlled. This has lead to wide fluctuation in prices. All existing infrastructure has declined. Private mandis operate in many parts which charge commission from farmers. Traders sell the grains in other states at MSP, where mandis are operational. Small and marginal farmers cannot sustain their families on the income, thus have to work in farms in Punjab and Haryana.

I'll add two more things in relation to Bihar. First, when the Bihar government repealed the APMC act, it did not abolish the mandis. They just went into a decline without funds or investment. Second, the government promised to procure grains for PDS (Public Distribution System) at MSP through PACS (Primary Agriculture Cooperative Societies). However, these institutions have been a disaster. They fail to meet the procurement target, and are not able to ensure even the MSP.

> Bihar was a pioneer in abolishing Agriculture Produce Marketing Committees (APMC).

More than 86% of Bihar’s marginal agricultural households are in debt compared to the national average of 63.6%. The agricultural growth rate fell to 0.6% in 2018-19 and crops recorded a negative growth rate of 3.9%.

> A study by the National Council of Applied Economic Research post the APMC reforms concluded that net income had been declining. Mr. Kumar’s government has simply abandoned Bihar’s farmers, who receive a price much lower than the MSP due to inefficiencies by procurement agencies. More than 80% of procurement centres have shut down since 2015. This Rabi season, less than 1% of Bihar’s wheat was procured.

**Addendum**

The Print has published a video comparing the agricultural economy of Punjab and Bihar. The video has made many erroneous claims, and false equivalencies.

[Punjab & Bihar: tale of 2 states — one slowing, one rising — and case for farm reforms - YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kczsvCZ6hOY)

First Shekhar Gupta compared the total GSDP of Punjab and Bihar. Bihar indeed grew more faster than national average after Nitish Kumar came to power. But that is because of manufacturing and services. Agriculture growth, first increased a little, due to agricultural roadmaps introduced by Nitish Kumar, but has contracted again since past several years.

> The average annual growth in agriculture and allied activities during the pre-agriculture road map (2001-02 to 2007-08) was only about 2.0 per cent (Table 3.1).  During the period of the first agriculture road map, the growth rate accelerated to 3.1 per cent, which was almost equal to the national average agricultural growth. However, this higher growth in agriculture did not sustain in the long run. In fact, the average annual growth rate declined to 1.28 per cent during the period of the second agriculture road map. During the overall period 2001- 02 to 2016-17, average growth was only 2.0 per cent, which was much below the national average agricultural growth of 3.1 per cent.

*Study on Agricultural Diagnostics for the State of Bihar in India: National Council Of Applied Economic Research, page 37.*

Mr. Gupta said, that while agriculture in Punjab grew much faster following the green revolution, it stagnated later, and is growing slower than average now. This is not surprising at all. GDP (or GSDP) growth is how much your GDP (or GSDP) increased in the current year compared to previous year. If you are growing quickly, and you reach to a significantly high position, you cannot keep growing at the same pace forever. How this argument was used to compare Punjab of today and Bihar of today is anyone’s guess.

Shekhar Gupta claimed that Bihar achieved 4.7% growth in agricultural sector between 2006-15, and 7% in last five years. (12 min into the video). Both the claims are false.

So I thought of sharing things which I witness while living in Bihar as a kid.

Firstly, Nitish Kumar does not mean BJP. He is just another politician who is with BJP because he knows BJP wave is strong. He looked the other way and worked with the grand alliance when he felt he could win without BJP in 2014 and we all know what happened in the next couple of years.

Few things that I witnessed as a kid in the Lalu raj:
1. Kidnapping: No kid was safe in the state. I knew a kid who got kidnapped because his father got his house painted. Which meant he was earning enough to give some extra money to the goons who were sponsered by RJD. There are many such stories.

2. Shooting in broad daylight: I lost 2 uncles to it and a friend's sister to it. All because ""Lalu Raj me paisa kaise kama liye be, o bhi rangdari tax bina"".

3. Bomb blasts: Seen 2 bomb blasts. 1 was to scare the businessmen (father of the said friend who lost his sister). The second one was by RJD goons for robbing the polling booth on election day. We used to play on a government school ground. It was not big enough and usually we were the only group of people who used to play there. This also used to be a voting booth during elections. During one such election day we were playing outside the school and then we heard a loud blast. We didn't understand what happen and just ran for our life. Luckily none of us got injured.

4. Massive underdevelopment: The City I used to live in was one of the major cities of Bihar and yet it used to get 3-4 hours of power. This is during 90s and early 2000s. The state had not developed 1 bit during the 15 years of hell under RJD. Floods were common during every monsoon (they still are). Roads have never existed. Garbage everywhere. What not.

It was a living hell and I am so glad I was able to escape it. Now it is still quite bad in terms of development, but at least people are not scared to step out after 7 at night. Kids can go out without great of death or kidnapping. People can spend their hard earned money for their comfort without the need of paying rangdari tax.

These are just a couple of points. There are many such horror stories and many such families which left their homes and everything because they had lost their loved ones to the horrors of Lalu Raj.

So no I would never want the asshole Lalu Prasad Yadav or his family to terrorize the land again.",Biharis will get thrashed in Maharashtra and Gujarat but still suck modi’s dick because of Muslim hatred. ,2020-11-11 13:47:27

In some ways it tackles the real issues and is not afraid to address them, and doesn't seem to contain any fluff. Its quite interesting that the actor who played Parulkar in Sacred Games, who's a dirty corrupt murdering cop who tortures innocents, plays a journalist who doesn't lift a finger but turns out to be the biggest scumbag in the show and worse.

IMO Sacred Games is overhyped. If you just look at the story without the cast, its pretty derivate of typical Bollywood gunda/gang movies, and it makes no sense at all - the actions of the main characters are stupid, and if any of them had acted with basic common sense it'd be over in 1 episode. It's still a great show.

Mirzapur tries to show rural India and the violence under the surface - its like Gangs of Wasseypur the series, but its not as good of course. I've just started watching S2. I think Guddu is a pretty stupid character and the actor who plays him isn't very good, and they focus too much on him. The best part of the show is Pankaj Tripathi who was also amazing in Sacred Games.",">IMO Sacred Games is overhyped.

>If you just look at the story without the cast

And it has a great story.

>its pretty derivate of typical Bollywood gunda/gang movies

I think the word you're looking for is genre, and with genre comes familiar and recognizable tropes Sacred Games indulges in these tropes(just like Paatal loke) but it has enough thematic depth to rise over the constraints of its genre.

Applied for a front end web dev internship at this company called ""yaarme"" on internshala which promised a stipend anywhere between 5k and 10k (based on performance) for a duration of 1 month 

Seems decent right ? 

I got selected along with 19 other people , out of nearly 4000 people that applied for it . I didn't think much about how expensive it is for them to hire these many people 

Turns out the guy who founded the company is one of those student entrepreneurs (basically wannabe Zuckerberg's) who's roughly the same age I am . This was when I knew I might get scammed , because one thing we all know about college students is that most of us are broke people (by that I mean , we rely on parents money and we dont generate any) and I was wondering how this guy is going to afford spending anywhere between 1 and 2 lakhs a month for his website 


I turned a blind eye to this as well because I thought maybe his college is sponsoring some of it (some colleges do offer entrepreneurship programs) and the rest is from his own pocket ,which seemed like a decent assumption to me 

Fast forward one month working for this guy , designing responsive templates for multiple webpages , he says I cant pay you because I havent used any of your work in my final product .... Here I was completely fooled by this guy who made me work for a month only to say ""I cant pay you because I havent used it ""

Turns out he said the same thing to people who's work has been used in his final project but he refuses to see their message and acknowledge it 
I have reported yaarme (the company) to internshala but I doubt anything of value would be done

So heres the thing, he hired 20 people made them work for a month and now refuses to pay a rupee to anyone... what a guy ... 

What can I do here ? Nothing , to be honest .... which sucks but I have to deal with 

To hell with yaarme and its founders for wasting my time on this , this was an online internship and they didn't teach me anything like a conventional internship would , they didn't give feedback so I just assumed the work I did was decent , I didn't learn anything new here , complete waste of time 


Key takeaway from this post is that you check on who you're going to work for , check if you're going to learn something valuable from them and most important of all is if it's worth it ...",Take off the companies name from this post.

Two products that stand out to me are Oreo and Snickers.

Putting an Oreo from another country against an Oreo made in India is like comparing Apple's and Oranges. There's simply nothing in common between the both of them except for the name.

The colour is totally different, the flavours of the biscuit itself is different, the cream is different and frankly, feels extremely cheap and has that wannabe-chocolate-but-basically-coloured-sugar taste and feel.

The exact same thing can be said about Snickers which is made for India. And Nutella. They taste vastly different and I've put them side-by-side and tasted them and I'm quite sad to say that it's always the one made for India or made in India that's subpar in quality.

And yet, we trust that brand. Oreo. Nutella. Snickers. That brand makes us trust their quality and expected taste only to be disappointed. In fact, a lot of the local brands are seriously better.

If anyone here has had a similar experience or can relate to my experience, could we upvote this or start some sort of website or something to :

1. Make people aware that these fellows are fooling us with their brand + subpar quality
2. Highlight and promote better local alternatives for these products
3. Call out these people trying to fool us?

* A few young (teen) girls and ladies can be seen going in and out at odd hours, escorted by the Auto-bouncer
* This Diwali, the goons from this building got a video crew to film the girls with fireworks. They spent a bomb on the bombs (pun) including a series of “10,000 bombs,” 10-foot flowerpots etc etc. Girls were in ‘traditional sarees’ decked in flowers for an hour before they switched to frilly westerns continuing the firework show
* This morning – at around 4.30 am, there was a ruckus in the building and a couple of guys came out shouting profanities before they got in a car and left, waking the neighbors
* I suspect there is a lot more than just “Thai Massage” that is going on in the building - you get the idea

https://preview.redd.it/ectct4kd9yz51.png?width=1024&format=png&auto=webp&s=75e07b5b01bfe2e82f7f170da5f1917ab3678c25

### Tl;dr

Today we wrote to the Delhi Government urging against mandatory imposition of the Aarogya Setu app. Our alarm bells were rung by a circular issued by the Excise Department which directed licensed wholesale liquor vendors to ensure mandatory use of Aarogya Setu by every worker. In our representation, we have called upon the Delhi Government to withdraw the circular issued by the Excise Department and we have also sought issuance of an advisory to all departments clarifying that use of the Aarogya Setu app is purely voluntary and no person should be denied access to goods or services for failing to use the app.

### Background

The Aarogya Setu app was launched by the Ministry of Electronics & Information Technology as a proximity exposure notification app on 02 April 2020 and it has been mired in controversy since its release. Concerns have been raised about misuse and breach of sensitive personal data collected by the app and legal experts have cautioned against deployment of such technologies in the absence of a data protection law in India. Public health experts have also[ **explained**](https://internetfreedom.in/aarogya-setu-multi-domain-joint-statement/) why such apps cannot substitute on the ground contract tracing by healthcare workers and questioned the government's failure to explain why information available through existing databases is insufficient. Finally, technologists have [**warned**](https://internetfreedom.in/kerala-hc-hears-challenges-against-mandatory-imposition-of-aarogya-setu/) that Aarogya Setu relies on weak anonymization techniques which make its users susceptible to re-identification and [**criticized**](https://internetfreedom.in/aarogya-setu-should-be-open-source-now/) the lack of transparency surrounding the app's code and algorithms.

### Stop the Voluntary-Mandatory Game

The central government has repeatedly claimed that use of the Aarogya Setu app is voluntary but ground realities paint a very different picture. We have been closely tracking mandatory imposition of Aarogya Setu by different institutions including [**airports**](https://internetfreedom.in/aarogya-setu-air-travel-survey/), [**court complexes**](https://internetfreedom.in/aarogya-setu-delhi-district-courts/) and [**resident welfare associations**](https://internetfreedom.in/aarogya-setu-rwas/). Most recently, our alarm bells were rung by a circular [**issued**](https://www.livelaw.in/news-updates/delhi-government-makes-use-of-aarogya-setu-app-mandatory-for-wholesale-liquor-vends-staff-in-delhi-165270) by the Delhi Government's Department of Excise on 27 October 2020 which directed licensed wholesale liquor vendors to ensure *“mandatory use of Aarogya Setu app by every worker.”* The circular further stated that Bond Inspectors are required to ensure compliance with this direction and submit a certificate within 3 days.

In our representation, we have called upon the Delhi Government to withdraw the circular issued by the Excise Department mandating use of the Aarogya Setu app by liquor store workers. We have also sought issuance of an advisory to all departments of the Government of NCT of Delhi clarifying that use of the Aarogya Setu app is purely voluntary and no person should be denied access to goods or services for failing to use the app. In support of these demands, we have highlighted the following concerns about legality and effectiveness of the Aarogya Setu app and explained how its mandatory imposition could lead to privacy violations and exclusion.

### (IL)Legality

Despite collecting sensitive health and location data of millions of Indians, the Aarogya Setu app lacks any legislative basis and powers have not been provided under any statutory instrument to mandate use of the app. In an [**interview**](https://indianexpress.com/article/india/aarogya-setu-app-mandate-illegal-justice-b-n-srikrishna-6405535/) with the Indian Express, Retired Justice BN Srikrishna who headed the Committee on Data Protection constituted by the MeitY has endorsed this view and stated that making use of the Aarogya Setu app mandatory without enabling legislation is completely illegal. Mandatory imposition of Aarogya Setu amounts to an infringement of fundamental rights of citizens because it could lead to privacy violations and exclusion, and therefore, such a measure must be supported by legislative authorization.

### Inaccuracy and Ineffectiveness

In addition to these legal concerns, mandatory imposition of the Aarogya Setu app may prove to be counterproductive at achieving its intended purpose of reducing COVID-19 transmission because of the inaccuracies inherent in app based contact tracing. Apps like Aarogya Setu rely on Bluetooth and GPS signals which cannot accurately estimate whether someone has been in close proximity (6 feet or less) of a COVID-19 infected person, and this can lead to a high number of false positives and false negatives. For instance, Bluetooth signals cannot recognize physical barriers such as walls and floors which make virus transmission impossible, and therefore, they may misidentify individuals as COVID-19 positive and send the authorities on a wild goose chase. Similarly, since Bluetooth based apps cannot account for surface to person transmission, they will also yield false negatives and provide a false sense of security to infected individuals.

### Past Central Government Practice

It should be noted that authorities of the central government have also recognized that use of the Aarogya Setu app cannot be made mandatory for workers. For instance, on 01 May 2020, the Ministry of Home Affairs had issued guidelines which made use of the Aarogya Setu app mandatory for all public and private sector employees and the head of an organization was responsible for ensuring 100% coverage of the app among all employees. After this decision was challenged before the Kerala High Court, MHA [**issued**](https://internetfreedom.in/aarogya-setu-victory/) revised guidelines on 17 May 2020 which encouraged use of the Aarogya Setu app on a ""best efforts"" basis but stopped short of making it mandatory.

More recently on 22 August 2020, MeitY launched an Open API Service to enable employers to receive real-time information about the risk status of their employees, customers and users. However, the [**Terms of Service**](https://openapi.aarogyasetu.gov.in/tandc) of the Open API Service clearly state that explicit consent of the user is necessary to access data collected by the Aarogya Setu app and alternative methods to avail a service must be provided to users who do not grant such consent.

The guilt and weight on my shoulder will forever remain stuck with me as long as I may breath. The circumstances in which we lost you, and the role I could have played, to save you, the end result might have been different & you may still be there with us, and I still remember both of us talking in our morse code whistles as soon as we used to step out of our door. Since we had adajcent houses. Tears are rolling down my eyes as I type this now,but it's time to get these things off my chest. They say the void that you left will take time to heal, but certain voids aren't meant to be filled. I remember the day when you brought a game for my new computer and as soon as you arrived there it was a view that we cherrised for the rest of our lives. ""Dono bhai bhen murge bane hue tha darwaze ke bahr. Aur bhai upar railing se latak ke dekh rha ki kuch bolon ya kat loon ab"". I remember when I came back from Chandigarh after leaving my job, and having lunch in his house the next day. I was seating on the dinning table, lost in own world despite eating my usual best meal of my life, tai ke hath ke lip smacking, daal chawal and kadi. Bhai, shop se aya dekha bola, shukar hai yra agya tu, tere bina ghr khali khali se lagta tha. I just hmmed, I was stressed about my future and didn't paid much attention what I was eating. He quietly went to the kitchen, and came with a plate full of onions for me, and said aise kaisa ho gya abu pyaz ke khana kha rha and left for shop again. There was something else about that person, he had a charm an essence of selflessness like no other.All it would take was just a few meetings and conversation of you with him, and he would happily turn the world and stride, upside down for you. Despite you being a total stranger to him. He was one of a kind, gem. Those who know him would agree. Some of his favourite quotes:
1) Chak janaga, dekha janga (Just sleep, when it's time to sleep and fuck everything else)
2) Oy meriye dasse kithi janwa fassse (When you stuck in some deep shit)
3) Baal bade sardar de, paer bade gawar de (He loved saying it to me)

I traveled most of the Himachal with him, in his creta. To me despite being an avid photography enthusiast and travell lover it was heavenly. But with him it wasn't just about the destination, it was all about the journey and his company that used to bring a smile to my face, and a peace to my heart. Bhai, sath hai fir kya scene hai, dekhi jayegi! I enjoyed that some company equally well even when he would just swing by cave room and do nothing. That's the thing when you love someone unconditionally, it doesn't matter what you guys are doing together, as long as you are together. His love for me was unconditional and in the purest of forms.Maybe I couldn't let him know what he meant, to me when he was alive. Not many people had the balls and courage to walk into his man cave of a room at 4/30 in the morning and scream at him "" Bhai raat ko barca match har gyi hai, soya ni hoon aur neend aa ni rhi chal morning walk krne chlana hum dono ne "".  Since, than we made it a routine for the next two months. Hopefully, we will meet again in that so called another dimension, and party like we used to. May you rest in peace, YUGAL BHAI ❤️ ABU",RIP ,2020-12-14 07:22:01

621,This Happened at the service center of One Plus when my phone stopped working,7wiwf3,india,1175,False,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/7wiwf3/this_happened_at_the_service_center_of_one_plus/,199,Unverified,"I was in Agra with my friend working on a photo series when in the morning my phone went bonkers. I have anOne Plus 5 128 gb (8 gb Ram), got it in November. It was their flagship phone. I am a heavy user, hence the specs. My most of the work depends on the phone and like most of the folks, it's very important, to the extent that I lose money when I don't have it. Anyway, so in Agra, while browsing my phone swirched off abruptly and didn't start. I tried a couple of times, checked online about the issue from the other phone but it didn't help. I had a flight to catch the next day, moving out of India. I looked up for service center in Agra. There is none. I am furious. I cut short my trip and came back to Delhi, just to get my phone checked. As soon as I reached the Saket Exclusive center, I explained my issue and urgency to the guy on the front desk (Jitendra) and you won't believe what happened. Well Nothing, he simply understood my situation and quickly started working on it. After the diagnosis of about 30 mins, it turns out the phone's motherboard has fried up(rare issue) and it needs a part replacement. They didn't have the part at the center. In any other case of mobile service they'd ask me to take the phone after 7 days or so and then keep delaying for another 10 days (has happened a lot), but he immediately calls up other service centers in Delhi to check the part. It's available in Rajouri Garden. I went to Rajouri Garden service center. There is a guy waiting for me with the part ready and holding other work at hand. I gave my phone and it was back in my hand after 45 minutes. The guy named Atik, infact the whole team was quick to address the issue in the case of emergency. Within 2.5 hours of getting in touch with their team (minus the travel time) I got my phone repaired.

What's the point of this story ? We are always writing negetive feedback, it's human nature. We shout only when we are unhappy and at times never appreciate when things go right. I have had bad experiences and this is the kind of service I am not used to in India. I hope all the company take a lesson and work on the service model and keep their customers in mind. 


P.S I am regular user and not advertising anything but wanted to share the good service experience. 

TL;DR Phone stopped working, Oneplus center quickly resolved it instead of dragging it. Positive experience.

The  very beginning just struck me as laughable. It's about a police officer  who commits suicide because he got accused of being corrupt. So even  though he has a wife and child, he kills himself. Which just came off  funny to me. Especially with the over the top ...everything.  
And at  the end of the film the hero cop, Singham, just executes the villain who  ""made"" the other cop kill himself. Singham does this together with the  other ""none-corrupt"" cops. Together, they cover up the murder they  committed and declare that the villain blew his own brains out. Which  kinda blew my mind to be honest. It would be a different thing if he  gave up his position as a representative of the justice system and went  rogue. But he didn't. So it comes off as really bizarre.

Year was 2002, and Nokia 3310 was the rage. I was 2500 kms away from home, in Mangalore, just after my 12th for MSc.. Parents gifted me 3310, and well, I lost it.

A local bully made me a friend, then one day asked for my mobile for a few hours, as he claimed he was going to meet his girlfriend. I gave him the charger as well, in case.. And the next day he flew to Dubai.

I could have told my parents and they would have sent another one, but I took it personally. I cannot break their trust.

I decided to earn Rs 5000 in 7 days and buy another 3310, and since the entire hostel and college were empty for Diwali vacations, I had to do it on my own.

There is this Laxmi College there, and hotel management guys conducted annual Diwali party, with Rs 200 odd entry ticket. DJ, food, dance and booze. The guy from the organizing team told me to sell one booklet of tickets, and get Rs 300 as commission. And one ticket free.

I sold 10 booklets, that is 100 tickets. I went from shop to shop, on foot, pitching the party to youngsters and the uncles. They bought it happily.

Then I worked as an ice-cream seller at a big fare which was happening in the middle of the city. Some Rs 200 for 5 hours of work. Sold some 100 ice creams, and got Rs 100 extra too.

Then I joined an ODC team.. Which is Outdoor Catering Service. A huge party at a seaside resort near Suratkal was happening, and one good soul took me in. Unlimited food and Rs 500 per day was promised. Served food wearing a uniform, greeted the guests and escorted them out when the party was over.

Records tell that I made more than Rs 5000 that week, and bought a new phone. It was a Samsung model with bright colors and funky music.

Keep in mind by no means I'm an expert in programming, I'm myself learning languages currently but I feel confident enough to clear up basic concepts for people who are new to coding, and even help them by suggesting good resources and youtube vids from where they can learn further.  


It's completely FREE and I don't need anything in return, and if anyone's interested, I can teach by screen-sharing over discord / Gmeet / Zoom etc. and can do this for a group of people at once as well ( in case you 4-5 friends are looking forward to start coding ).  


I'm not looking forward to take 10s of class with each person, I'll prefer helping clear up doubts and basic concepts  of everyone in max 1 or 2 sessions, which will completely be planned according to when I can make time from my own curriculum.

One of them asked  me how to explain ""algorithm"" to a 8 year old. Which to me was very dumb  because at 8 they're learning basic scratch and their language  acquisition skills aren't developed enough to even spell algorithm.

I am an tier 1 engineering college graduate in ECE (2018) but due to family problems and then an fall accident(back and leg injury) i wasn't able to start my career well at all.

During my late recovery phase i joined an technical startup in a majorly non technical role due to my situation but got jobless during march this year due to covid.

I had interest in coding since school time and was well versed in python during my college so took it up again and after researching well on web as well as with some batchmates i got the suggestion that data science with python should be my way to go as it could help me grab a good package in today's scenario and i tried learning through various MOOCs and then did some basic and entry level projects also and finally started getting shortlisted for interviews and technical rounds for internships and entry level roles during mid August.

I got rejected in most of the interviews due to various reasons like zero technical experience to requiring a more experienced candidate to some companies totally changing their t&c that i will have to be on an unpaid intern for 3 months and then will get the job according to my performance.

During September my father got a heavy exposure to covid and was literally at such a worst condition we ever saw in our life that i wasn't able to give any more interviews or study anything and my whole time was spent in him and in October due to my his negligence me and my sibling also got affected and my October month got into Drain as well.

In November we all recovered and after taking care of all the mess of covid i started of thinking getting back on track but again i was not getting shortlisted for any interviews at all and i had to revise some things again as i had just studied them before covid so i asked suggestions from some friends about how should i proceed.

They gave various suggestions like private job will make my life further hell and i should prepare for gov jobs and all since i already have been jobless for so long and during 2018 i scored less than 2 -5 marks in gov job exams that too without coaching so they said that it will be much better for me than this but being jobless for more months was already haunting enough and after that since we already were low or money my father's abusive behaviour made me think too much about that part.

Some friends suggested that data science is all name and requires too much experience to enter and i should instead look on web development where i could learn js and angular within 3 months and start my career in that and it has also good money and all.

Some suggested giving 3 - 4 Months to data structures and algorithms and that if i master it then no company in the world would be able to reject me.

One guy due to my financial problem suggested joining a mass recruiter such as infosys or tcs but others said that it would be real bad for me and instead i should prepare well and i could be in a much better place within 4-5 months instead of them and since i have so much financial burden mass recruiters salary won't be of much help either way.

With so many suggestions and getting stuck due to all these factors such as injuries and covid and then restarting everything again has made me even more depressing on what should i actually do.

Sometimes due to my father's abusive behaviour i think of getting into a mass recruiter so that i can help financially as much as i can and that he stops his narcissistic behaviour a little but then other's suggestions also come in my mind and i am extremely confused and feel totally lost.

I know most will think that i am getting to whiny and being a cry baby but i was a bright student but all these injuries and things like covid which made me lose on opportunities make me too much depressing since i see people who passed by cheating on their papers with my help doing much better than what i am doing currently.

Sorry for such a long and crybaby post but if you have read till here and have some good suggestion please do help me out.

There is a concept called Hypernormalization. It speaks towards the chaotic state of the world at the moment and how governments deploy this tool in even the most advanced countries to enhance the state of confusion and conflict by creating this smog to facetiously divert public opinion and establish capitalist agendas. In Hypernormalization, we ignore the fundamental problems of the society while our focus/ attention is continuously diverted so things seem to be normal.

1. Maximum tax money is contributed by the South as a whole.
2. Maximum expenditure is made on the North.
3. Policy decisions are always in favour of the North due to the majority representation in Parliament.
4. Government recruitment favours those with Hindi as mother tongue, whereas others have to learn English and fight on a non-level ground. (Even NCERT prints stuff in Hindi aiding the Hindi populace dominate over the non-Hindi)
5. Border conflicts are an issue of the North. (South as a separate country would have not a security issue with the North but a migrant issue like India now has with Bangladesh)
6. South has coast line which encourages trade.
7. Southern mind is progressive whereas Northern society is largely regressive with enormous amount of social evil.

I live in jammu and we also dont have any support. I really dont know what to do anymore. If only one of my family member was healthy but that isnt the case.

EDIT 2: Thanks for all the feedback, i didnt really expect much. I dont rely on social media this much but the situation is just something a person cannot handle alone. I am going to start mesalamine enemas which is similar to sulfazine as some people have stated below and see how it goes. My diet is the usual north india diet i guess. I have stopped eating stuff that makes my symptoms worse and am only eating specific foods. My most immediate concern is for my mother as she has severe anxiety for a long time now. She is suffering quiet a lot. We are trying different meds and i hope some of them work as with my father also having cancer it is getting quiet difficult to handle. And on top of all that is covid. I am stuck in jammu and cant go to other states even if i wanted to. I would also like to stay in contact with people who have ibd because i guess i just have to deal with the till the day i die.

> Violence erupted at Wistron&#039;s iPhone manufacturing plant at Narasapura in Kolar district near Bengaluru on Saturday over delayed salary payments.

> &quot;The issue has been festering for about 8 to 10 weeks, during which employees were subject to arbitrary changes to their work contracts. About 90 per cent of the 8,000-strong workforce are contractual workers with a promised salary of Rs 16,000 per month for an 8-hour work shift. But over the last few months many were being paid only Rs 12,000 and were also told to work for up to 12 hours a day,&quot; the source said.

> &quot;The industrial violence in Wistron is a direct result of the brutal exploitation of workers and sweatshop-like conditions created by a company, manufacturing the most expensive mobile phones. The state government has allowed the company to flout the basic rights of the workers like payment of wages and working hours. In the absence of any regulation, anarchy has prevailed,&quot; he said.

738,Questions about LLP Taxations,k19xhy,india,4,False,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/k19xhy/questions_about_llp_taxations/,4,Business/Finance,"Posted this on r/LegalAdviceIndia, posting this here too for better visibility.

I'm planning to start a LLP with a partner, the idea is still in early stages. Just looking for answers to some questions, that aren't clear to me.  Sorry for the long post.

To keep things simple, Let's say I'm starting an IT service company. I'm starting with getting a loan of 10L (that I use to get computers and applications I use for core-business purpose). The gross total income of the company is 20L for that year. I pay 1L in interest for the loan that year

**Book profits and Expenditure on business machines and applications**

I get that income tax is a flat-rate of 30% on book profits. But what exactly is ""book profit""? I get that I can deduct the interest I pay on loans under deductions but what about the cost of computers? Can I show them as expense? 

So, in the example above, book profits could be calculated as:

1. Net profit = 20L - 1L = 19L
2. Net profit = 20L - 10L - 1L = 9L

Which one is correct? 

Also, on top of the interest, I'd be repaying the loan principal, Should that be marked as expenditure too?

**Depreciation of assets**

Can I claim asset depreciations (in my example, the computers) from the first year itself?

**Partner Remuneration and 44ADA**

I'm a partner and I get the remuneration from the company. Can I file my personal ITR using 44ADA?  Or will I be not eligible for 44ADA? 

**Assets/Investment from Firm's capital**

If I use the firm's capital to buy some assets or invest in stocks/MF in the firm's name, is that amount still taxable? Or should I pay the tax on those investments (capital + interests) when it matures? 

**Hiring Contractors**

Should I deduct TDS if I'm hiring contractors before I pay them out? What kind of records am I expected to maintain regarding contractors? Will an invoice from contractor be enough?",">  Book Profits

19L is correct. 10L isn't really an expense(assuming that's just the principal portion of the loan). You can get deductions for business expenses like salary,rent, electricity etc.

> Depreciation

Yes you can claim depreciation on fixed assets from first year itself.

> 44ADA

Partner's Remuneration is in the form of salary, so not eligible for 44ADA. 

> Capital

You only pay tax on income earned from such assets, capital is not taxable.

> hiring contractors

You don't need to deduct TDS, unless you're covered under tax audit (limit is 50L(professionals)/1Crore(others),so unless you cross the limit you don't need to worry about TDS.

I hope that helps. ",2020-11-26 14:21:37

There are huge funds in Maharashtra government accounts, deposited as part of funds for Bullet train. Centre, Maharashtra and Gujarat control these funds.

He has transferred almost all the money to central funds, making it impossible for new government to touch the funds.

He will resign now but they have prevented the Congress from poaching into Bullet train project. Sonia's insistence in her CMP was Farmer's loan waivers (the easiest way to scam, like they did in Karnataka and MP) and stop Modi's dream project of Bullet train.

This is just a rant. Read if you want, vote like you want. It's a democracy.


# Rant Begins
Recently the government brought reservation for the ""poor"". Not one soul immolated himself or herself. I remember the days of Indira Swahney Judgement and Mandal Commission, when reservation was extended to OBC and so many students immolated themselves.

Obviously I don't want people to burn and kill themselves (not publicly anyway), however, this clearly shows the bigotry in the Indian thinking. Merit is ruined only by socially backwards castes getting reservation. But not if the ""upper caste"" get it.

When reservation was extended on social grounds, it was against merit. And Merit is the ultimate aim. This is ironically coming from Indians who practiced the fucking caste system for thousands of years, and denied upward mobility.

But when reservation would benefit them, no one cried out for the ""death of merit"" or ""a race to the bottom"".

It just makes me feel, that Indians remain more casteist than ever, just this casteism has been hidden, or subdued.

All the butthurt people are those who didn't get into good colleges, and hence reservation is bad. 

What they don't look at is, discrimination continues, despite there being reservation. Fucking IIT Profs practiced casteism (at Kanpur, proved by the investigation committee, google it). There is segregation at school level, society and matrimony.

If we remove reservation, what is the solution? How would we ensure upward mobility? That's what the upper caste are most scared of. 

# Rant ends","I have met people who actually deserve reservation and I know that I am not one of them.

The very first time I fell into depression it sucked. I was behaving very unlike INTJ. My confidence vanished into thin air, I was passionless, hopeless, dreamless, my emotions got the better of me and I was like a dead soul, with a dead and rotten mind(the most precious part of me). It was due to my acads and my depression lasted until unexpectedly something that I never expected happened in my academic life-I got into a good college that I very much wanted to BUT I got in only because of this thing called reservation(Indian context). **I still feel very guilty over it and I beat myself over it almost every fucking day.** The worst part is I know that I would have been able to anyway get into this college even without reservation if it were not for my depression.

I can't help it, even though I know I'm being irrational. It isn't just me who's feeling depressed, it's the whole world right now.

My lessons are open to all, and I genuinely love sharing the gift of music with others. You're welcome to message me if you're interested.

Am I wrong, though, for feeling this way? For feeling anxiety and finding myself in the self-doubt zone? Please, connect with me and tell me I'm not the only one. I'd appreciate some words of encouragement. 💛","There's this website fiverr, one can post their work their as well.

Last week, she messaged me out of blue accusing me of having leaked her video on a porn site. She's threatening me to file a police complaint against me. I'm sure I never did what she's implying, so police cannot ideally find any evidence against me. In best case, I will be interrogated. In worst case, I will be their scapegoat. 

I haven't replied to her at all. Because anything I might say would be construed wrongly given the distress she's in. I don't think my silence is helping either but it won't be held against me. I obviously cannot ask her to link me to the video to verify if it's the one I have seen. There's a good chance it can be some other boyfriend of hers. 

My main concern if this goes to the cops, will my involvement as an accused dog me throughout the rest of my life? Will it affect my chances of getting a professional visa or even residency? I cannot get myself to risk my career at this point. 

Please refrain from making jokes. I expect serious opinions/anecdotes. Thank you.","In your visa application form, they will ask if you were ever charged or prosecuted in any crime, so this will definitely affect your emigration chances if you get charged as guilty.

I moved to the North East around a year back in the summer months. The most drastic change, bar none, had been the time of the Sun rising in the morning and the Sun setting in the evening. And now after more than an year, I am still not accustomed to the Solar Cycle here and get depressed every evening seeing that it is already dark outside by the time it is time to leave from office.

The reason for this is the fact that India has one single time zone for the whole wide country where we have a longitudinal extent of around 29° from our westernmost state of Gujarat at 68°7′E to the eastern most state of Arunachal Pradesh at 97°25′E which is 2933 kms.

This difference of around 29° longitude, amounts to almost 2 (!) hours of difference between the sun setting or the sun rising at the two extreme points of India at 4 minutes per degree longitude.

Now, the difference between where I am living now, and where I have grew up and have spent most of my life, is around 19 degrees, which when calculated at 4 minutes per degree longitude, amounts to 01 hour & 16 minutes, which is huge, and has thrown my whole circadian rhythm into whack.

Now this is only a personal scale, for a single individual, when this is extrapolated to the whole easternmost half of the country, imagine what losses a single time zone must have caused psychologically and financially generation on generation due to the multiple hours of wasted daylight, loss of productivity and no synchronization of circadian rhythm with light–dark cycle.

Historically in the North Eastern states, both [civil](https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/op-ed/one-india-two-time-zones/article17653169.ece) & [political] (https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/Gogoi-for-separate-time-zone-for-Assam/articleshow/28252502.cms) society have been demanding and campaigning for a separate time zone.

The former Chief Minister of Assam, the late Tarun Gogoi, had also suggested/ campaigned for a separate time zone for the northeastern states which would have been ahead of the IST [by at least an hour to 90 minutes](https://www.ndtv.com/india-news/india-could-get-second-time-zone-with-assam-one-hour-ahead-546592).

In fact the famous Chai Bagans of Assam, have been using their own informal time zone since before independence, known as the [Chai Bagaan time](https://www.vahdam.com/blogs/news/assam-tea-gardens-have-their-own-time-here-s-the-story-of-bagan-time), at IST + 1 hour helping them maximise  their productivity.

An [article published in Current Science Journal Vol. 115, No. 7, 10/10/2018](https://www.currentscience.ac.in/Volumes/115/07/1252.pdf) by authors from Council of Scientific and Industrial Research–National Physical Laboratory (CSIR–NPL), Dr K. S. Krishnan Marg, Lakhi Sharma, S. De, S. Panja, P. Arora, A. Agarwal, T. D. Senguttuvan, V. N. Ojha and D. K. Aswal (director of NPL) who are also in Academy of Scientific and Innovative Research (AcSIR), CSIR-NPL, propose an implementable solution that puts the country into two time zones:

> 1: IST-I (UTC + 5:30 h, represented by longitude passing through 82°33′E) covering the regions falling between longitude 68°7′E and 89°52′E, and
> 
> 2: IST-II (UTC + 6:30 h, represented by longitude passing through 97°30′E) encompassing the regions between 89°52′E and 97°25′E. 

Their research carries weight as the authors are from CSIR-NPL which functions as the ’National Meteorology Institutes (NMI)’ for India being the signatory of ‘Metre Convention,’ and is [responsible for generation and dissemination of the IST](https://www.nplindia.in/time-and-frequency-metrology-section) as the official time keeper of India.

This is a great paper demonstrating the necessity for 2 time zones showing implementable solutions and also showing the benefits once such a proposal is implemented. However I am attaching their summary here too:
    
> In this article we have shown that the two time zones, namely IST-I (UTC + 5:30 h) and IST-II (UTC+6:30 h), indeed are a requirement of the country. The demarcation line between IST-I and IST-II passes through the border of West Bengal and Assam and falls at longitude 89º 52’E. The states falling under IST-II would be Assam, Meghalaya, Nagaland, Arunanchal Pradesh, Manipur, Mizoram, Tripura and, Andaman and Nicobar Islands. Implementation of IST-II in these states would not only enhance the efficiency of populace as their daily working hours get synchronous to the circadian clocks, but would also save significant amount of energy. The rest of India remains under IST-I. Technically, the two time zones in the country can be easily implemented by CSIR-NPL as it has the desired mandate and the expertise. 

There have been many debates in the political, civil & the scientific community for the need of multiple time zones in the country, but as it stands today, there has been no visible progress towards implementation.

Any change to this end is only possible with better awareness between the general populace of the country and a serious political will at the centre.

---

Now, this is where I wish to discuss with you people, the possibility of giving implementation to an idea that I have which I think may help demonstrate and build awareness the need for multiple time zones and hopefully inspire action towards creation of a separate timezone. 

Many of us may be familiar with the website [WindowSwap](https://window-swap.com/) that come up during the initial months of quarantine. It is a great website showing a  view from different windows world over by having people record and upload 10 minutes of view from their windows an submitting to the website.

Inspired by the above website, I had an idea to build a website, which on its landing page will have 3-4 different panels side by side showing live view from different locations demonstrating the extent of difference in Solar time from West to East of the country. Additionally with each view labelled with the time difference between the IST and the Mean Solar time at that location.

I imagine this could help provide some perspective visually to people from different areas and help understand and appreciate the importance of having a time zone as synchronised as possible to the local mean solar time.

Now the big stumbling block I have here is, I have absolutely zero idea on where to start on building such a website as I am computer programming illiterate.

So I am throwing this idea to the community for your help to figure out if such an idea is even feasible and how can I go about implementing this. As this would not only take building the website and purchasing hosting space, but also volunteering of at least 4-5 people to share live video feeds form the different parts of India say from someone’s terrace, a park, a market area etc. I have searched some public webcam feeds too but there are no good feeds available for India, if at all, that may be considered useful.

Hoping for some help and guidance.

In fact the members, including the Director of the [official time keeper of India](https://www.nplindia.in/time-and-frequency-metrology-section) have [published an article](https://www.currentscience.ac.in/Volumes/115/07/1252.pdf) showing how to implement 2 time zones and have also demonstrated its necessity. I propose an idea to building a website like [WindowSwap](https://window-swap.com/) which will have 3-4 different panels side by side showing live view from different locations demonstrating the extent of difference in Solar time from West to East of the country to help raise awareness for this cause. But as I don't seem to have necessary expertise for implementing this idea, I am seeking the community's help.",It's not that easy to implement. ,2020-11-29 22:02:42

If it's not allowed then mods can delete the post.

  


I study in Jamia Millia Islamia and our university decided to inform us on 8th December that they have decided to hold all the exams from 21st onwards and the mode will be proctored online exams. This mode of exam will require that every student has good internet connection which doesn't fluctuate. A large number of students come from rural areas and J&K, and most of them, barring few rich ones who can afford broadband, don't have proper internet to give these exams. Several student bodies then tried to talk to authorities, sign petitions, etc etc.

  


But today the university dropped another bomb. They have just released set of guideline for these proctored exams and it's not just exclusionary but completely ridiculous. I am attaching today's notice and also highlighting some of the rules which won't be possible for most of us to follow.

I am sharing this here, in order to make more people aware of what's happening and how it will put so many student's careers at risk. TBH even i will have trouble giving these exams and i am not as unprivileged as some students who don't even have a smartphone let alone a laptop and strong internet connection.

  


I am really worried about students who can't afford all these requirements and what they and their families must be going through right now Some of these students were even unable to attend the classes and now this. We have already seen many people taking their lives because of all this and yet this insensitivity of people holding power is really sad.","Yaar, /r/india is bipolar af.

> At 3pm on August 13 2004, Akku Yadav was lynched by a mob of around 200 women from Kasturba Nagar. It took them 15 minutes to hack to death the man they say raped them with impunity for more than a decade. Chilli powder was thrown in his face and stones hurled. As he flailed and fought, one of his alleged victims hacked off his penis with a vegetable knife. A further 70 stab wounds were left on his body. The incident was made all the more extraordinary by its setting. Yadav was murdered not in the dark alleys of the slum, but on the shiny white marble floor of Nagpur district court.

> Laughed at and abused by the police when they reported being raped by Yadav, the women took the law into their own hands. A local thug, Yadav and his gang had terrorised the 300 families of Kasturba Nagar for more than a decade, barging into homes demanding money, shouting threats and abuse.

> Residents say he murdered at least three neighbours and dumped their bodies on railway tracks. They had reported his crimes to the police dozens of times. Each time he was arrested, he was granted bail.

> He violated women to control men, ordering his henchmen to drag even girls as young as 12 to a nearby derelict building to be gang-raped.

>  Prominent among their supporters were 100 lawyers based in Nagpur who issued a statement saying the women should not be treated as the accused, but as the victims. 

> *One retired high court judge even congratulated the women. ""In the circumstances they underwent, they were left with no alternative but to finish Akku. The women repeatedly pleaded with the police for their security. But the police failed to protect them,"" said Justice Bhau Vahane.*

> On the day of Yadav's hearing, 200 women came to the court armed with vegetable knives and chilli powder. *As he walked in, Yadav spotted one of the women he had raped. He called her a prostitute and threatened to repeat the crime against her. The police laughed. She took off her sandal and began to hit him, shouting, ""We can't both live on this Earth together.

859,Engineer turned Gardener during COVID,iow8wd,india,268,False,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/iow8wd/engineer_turned_gardener_during_covid/,20,Food,"Hello, Due to the encouragement I received from the other groups. I wanted to share my story with you all wonderful people and I hope this will inspire you. I am a South Indian, born and raised in the city of UAE (Al Ain). It’s a city with very few plants and flowers. My dad comes from a family of farmers and working in the UAE as an engineer so with little knowledge he started planting basic plants such as Mint, Moringa, Curry plant, Aloe Vera, Tomato, Tapioca. Due to the heat and not so fertile soil, the harvest has been very low but we enjoyed working side by side. Those are the fondest memories I have with my father. 

In Kerala (India) the plot in which our house is built used to have a couple of coconut trees and jackfruit tree. We didn’t plant anything until now as we didn't have anyone to take care of our land. But due to COVID we got stuck here since January and hasn’t been able to go back to Dubai since. Due to fear of food shortages, we started using our three plots for farming. I could actively take part in all activities and I love to experiment (Dad doesn't). I have grown Beetroot greens, Potatoes and Sweet potato from scraps and they aren’t common crops in Kerala. We have planted plant of plenty of Tapioca, Indian yam, Colocasia, Elephant yam, Long beans, Small Chilli, Ladyfinger, Chilli, Ginger, Papaya, Neem, Moringa, Rhambutan and Tumeric. We have added passion fruit, more papayas, lemon, Giant lemon, Custard apple (sitaphal) and Sapotica (chicku) to our tree collection.

I have also started a YouTube channel and blog to document these journeys and talk about different culture through gardening. My dad was a camera man, recently we came to know that we both are COVID positive and he has been transferred to a hospital. My relatives and friends aren’t very supportive because they think gardening is a waste of time. But I love doing this and eating fresh from the garden is x10 times tastier than buying from the market. I have started educating people about importance of organic varieties and how to grow organically. I also started a food sharing and seed sharing program in our society. We ensure to share the produce with the less fortunate as they wouldn’t accept money. 

I make videos talking about the benefits, growing, harvesting and cooking vegetables such as banana flower, ladyfinger/ okra, bottle gourd/ doodhi (Lauki). This way the viewer can understand everything about a crop and learn how to use it as well. I am no expert; I still post my doubts on Facebook but I AM DETERMINED TO TURN EVERY INCH OF MY LAND INTO FOOD FOREST! This is how I plan to give back to my society.

The headline read: ""Sonia Gandhi not to celebrate her birthday in view of farmers's protests, Covid-19"". The vanity and self-regard in this public pronouncement was staggering, if entirely characteristic. Do the Gandhis think they are akin to royalty, so that the cancellation of one of their birthday parties becomes a mark of identification with their suffering subjects?

Wow Guha is such a fucking hack. She is merely standing in solidarity the best way she can (as super sick old woman) and this asshole tries to make it something it isnt.

I remember in my second year a batchmate died by suicide and we got a mail and the next day the whole institution worked like nothing had happened. There were no emails mourning the loss or asking students to meet them if they were affected by the loss. Not just authorities, most students had a very similar attitude. A batchmate of mine thought mental health issues aren't real; they are imaginary. They've Icare to deal with mental health issues which is an elaborate fraud. I hope someday someone will sue them. In India to practice as a Clinical Psychologist, a Mphil in Clinical Psychology is needed. No one on the team is qualified to be called one. Most of them hold Masters in Psychology or Clinical Psychology which isn't enough to practice alone but unfortunately the trend is very common in India. To work as a Counselor a diploma in counselling is needed and somehow they've overlooked the requirement. They even have someone with a Masters in Sociology and call her Social Psychologist. She conducts therapy sessions. They are pretty bad but that for them isn't enough to change the criterion.

]]]




Now before everyone starts judging me please know I wasn't always this obsessed about astrology. In fact I'm one of those people who keep logic and critical thinking at the forefront. However circumstances in life have made me so vulnerable and hopeless, that I'm spiraling down a rabbit-hole of astrology. 

My family, especially my mother and her side of the family have always been believers of vedic astrology and kundli horoscopes. In fact they used to consult someone who ended up predicting almost everything accurately in their lives and as a result their belief and trust in him grew. Since I was a kid I have always distanced myself from astrologers and their predictions. 

I remember whenever my parents would come back after taking me and my brother's kundlis for consultation, I would always just go sit in another room (when they'd discuss/tell us about it) because I didn't want to hear what the guy said. Firstly, because almost always it was something negative, and secondly, I felt it just ruined the mood and pushed you to make choices that you might not have considered before... turning the predictions into a sort of self fulfilling prophecy.

Now before I get into the astrology-bs I'm in, some back story:

I've had depression and anxiety as a teen. I've been to therapists a couple of times but it hasn't helped that much. 

I graduated from engineering in 2017 and even though I was a better student and scored fairly well, things didn't work out so well. Due to an unfortunate circumstance I lost the on-campus placement I had secured. People who were less smart than me now have better careers and lives. I was unemployed for 8 months until I found an unpaid internship with a great MNC. I tried hard but it never turned into a full on paid role. Somehow I managed to get an interview at a company thanks to a reference from my cousin and got placed there as a software trainee. Even the job and role in itself had no growth or learning, I was happy to be finally employed. That year itself I met and started dating my first ever boyfriend. 

So trouble began last year. The job was pathetic, my manager didn't treat me like a normal human and wouldn't even look me in the eye when he talked to me. He used to think trainees were useless and beneath him and ended up delegating someone else in the team the task to help me learn the ropes and get tasks done. I was so unhappy that I would often come home with an intention to put my papers the next day. But I kept on getting up every morning and dealing with it. 

I was never expecting that on a fine Monday morning when I'm called for a meeting with my manager it'd be because I was being laid off. It was out of the blue and it was shocking. I felt like a rug had been pulled from underneath me. My relationship with my boyfriend was a bit tumultuous before but from here shit started to hit the fan. From the last year we've been in an on/off relationship. There have been massive fights and he's broken my heart by telling me he doesn't love me and thinks that he might never be able to. When I broke up with him over that, he backtracked and said he could love me with time and that he doesn't want to lose me. The emotional fool I am, I took his manipulative bait. He's been toxic and emotionally abusive and immature but patient and sweet at the same time. It's been a hellish roller coaster. 

So when I lost my job again and got depressed my mother got worried. My cousin used to consult an astrology service at that time. Its a telecom company's calling astro service wherein astrologers speak to you on the phone and make predictions at Rs9/min. My cousin swore by this one specific astrologer she used to speak to at this service and naturally my mother decided to consult him(given the cool Rs9/min deal as well). 

He would predict overall good things, about my future and my relationship. Some of his predictions were accurate. With just the name of my bf he was able to tell what he looks like and the exact spot he has a mole on his face on as well as many of his characteristics. When I gave him my bf's birthdate, he always told me that my bf is a good guy by nature and he loves me but isn't able to express it. He used to tell me he'd never misguide me and that me and my bf actually do have a happy stable future together. I love my bf and obviously this gave me lots of hope so I kept enduring and overlooking things in the relationship. 

At the career front I applied to multiple jobs and would rarely get a call back. Whenever I did get a callback, I'd clear interview after interview till they'd reject me in the last round. I would call up the astrologer disheartened and he swore by the fact that I have an amazing career ahead of me and that ""mera guarantee hai apka iss mahine job lag jaega. Mai apko kabhi galat guide kar sakta hoon kya?"". He was telling me exactly what I needed to hear, both on the career and love front and I kept on believing him. But things never turned out quite like he said. I never got a job, my love life was bad and then covid hit. So when asked about his guarantee he used the excuse ""Ye toh parmata ka kaam hai. Parmata se bada koi nahi. Aur Covid toh sabke sath hi problems create kar raha hai, sirf aapke sath nahi"". 

As you can tell by now I had already built a dependency on it. Every time shit got bad mentally (and more often than not it was due to relationship issues), I'd call him up. I used to trust this astrologer because after talking to him I felt positive (because he was lying as I later find out). Whenever me and my bf would have a fight, I'd be really upset and unable to eat or sleep but the astrologer would predict the exact date after which my bf would contact me again and say sorry and it always came true. A few weeks ago he left that consultancy service and I started talking to someone else who was even more positive and I guess this is where I realised he was overselling it. My life wasn't as good as he kept saying. 

So on a random day I talked to a random guy from the service and not my ""regular"". He laid things out to me brutally honest. Apparently my kundli has a negative conjunction in the 7th house(the house of marriage and relationships). He said my kundli shows that I value relationships and bonds but unfortunately no matter who I'm with, my current bf or someone else, my relationships are bound to be rocky and always on the brink of breaking off. I will never get the amount of love I give back. There will always be problems. He said even my married life wouldn't be happy.  I also have Shani and Jupiter that'd delay my marriage and any career related ventures. 

In order to test his knowledge I asked him to tell me about my life so far. I gave him specific years to talk about and  99% of his words were accurate. He spoke about my past romantic likings and how even they never worked out well. How I've always had to struggle harder compared to my peers at school/college to get where they are and even then get unsuccessful results. How I was unemployed and struggled for a while before catching a break. Whatever he told me had happened to me, year by year, month by month. He predicted when I started my relationship, when I lost my job, and when my relationship started turning worse. I felt like he was playing a reel of my life just using my birthdate and time. He told me my life has been full of struggles from an early age and will continue to be so because it's in my kundli. 

Obviously this made my anxiety skyrocket. No one wants to hear their life isn't happy.. then what's the point of living (and believe me my depression makes me ask this question a lot). When he realised how low hearing all this made me feel, he gave me a lot of ""upaaye"" to strengthen my planets.  

I asked him philosophically if this is my destiny just because it's in my kundli and I was born at the wrong place or wrong time. I asked him if i can change things. He told me ""karm se sab kuch badal sakta hai"" which feels like such an oxymoron to all of it.

Needless to say, the break up happened with my bf to the point where he doesn't even want to talk about it or meet me. He's disrespectful, cold, and indifferent. We haven't met since Covid lockdown, it's been 9 months and he's showed no interest to talk things out or even make an effort to come meet me. I'm still unemployed. I have exhausted all my references, sent hundreds of applications and reached out to so many people but there is no hope in sight. I feel like my life is falling apart.

The astrologer even predicted the next 5-6 years of my life, and 2021 in a lot of detail. Things don't look good for me and it's giving me so much anxiety and worry. I don't know what to do and I'm scared. 

I am so dependent and obsessed with astrology now that I keep calling just to see if someone would say something else, something positive and interpret my kundli in some other way. I've wasted thousands of rupees making hour long calls. I can correlate a lot of the things this new astrologer said about my life and my personality to the reality that now I feel like I'm doomed. I feel helpless like no matter what I do, it's just not in my control. What's written is going to happen. I value relationships a lot, and I tried really fucking hard to make it work with my bf. I was supportive, loving, loyal without ans stayed by him without even getting half of the intensity back. If my karm and my efforts couldn't even change my destiny then what's the point. Same was with my efforts at the career front. Multiple references, multiple calls, multiple applications. Nothing works.

I'm just 25 but I'm really depressed, vulnerable, and helpless right now. I feel like my life has no meaning anymore and it just isn't worth continuing if I can't change things or have what I want even with hard work. I've become so desperate to be accepted and loved back, it's ruined my self esteem. I'd like to believe I'm a good person and I don't deserve any of this.

I've read about the [Barnum effect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barnum_effect) but I don't think it'd apply here as when you're on a call, the other person isn't getting all the visual and behavioral cues. I can't seem to accept that this is just cognitive bias since his ""past predictions"" were specific and spot on. 

I really need help. I've gone through below mentioned articles and multiple Quora posts about astrology and if its real. 

[Scientists said this](http://www.truthmagazine.com/archives/volume34/GOT034263.html)

[and this but I can't seem to think logically anymore. I used to be a smart woman :( Help](https://bogardiner.wordpress.com/2015/03/08/a-professional-astrologist-realizes-astrology-isnt-real/)

Nothing seems to take this crushing doomed feeling away (the astrologer said I have ketu over me right now and things should get better in a month -\_-) but I'm just tired of wasting money and hours and my energy obsessing over this. It's ruling my life right now and I fell like I have no control anymore.

I don't know how to get out of this mindset. I wish I had never got into astrology. My self confidence has been completely ruined. My life feels like it's in shambles. 

What have everyone else's experiences with astrology been like, especially when you've been to one who actually knew what he was talking about? How do I get out of this shit-hole and change my perspective? Please convince me all this is actual bullshit.

I want to believe I can create a life I think I deserve and not my what my stars think I should get.

Always she picked his calls in front of me like a friend. I feel so stupid for having that trust and that love for a slut. I never did anything wrong.

Can they ask police to trace my email if i use gmail on vpn. Should i take printout and send it to his home. I can get the address from her amazon account order.

910,Statement on MEA's RTI response on International Statement on E2E Encryption,jxjf9z,india,99,False,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/jxjf9z/statement_on_meas_rti_response_on_international/,12,Policy/Economy,"https://preview.redd.it/ha2vq6q10c061.png?width=1600&format=png&auto=webp&s=e72d271be7be37efc9b903ac7eb23329a7b3391d

On October 11, 2020 India became a signatory to the “International statement: End-to-end encryption and public safety”. Interalia the statement calls on technology companies to weaken end to end encrypted secure messaging by invoking concerns about public safety by stating, “enable law enforcement access to content in a readable and usable format”.  


India is one of the 7 known signatory countries. This is a concerning development because the use of encryption has again come under political attack by parts of the security ecosystem. In fact, failure to encourage and expand the usage of encryption technologies puts individual users at risk. Here millions of Indians who today conduct their lives through digital tools are also entry point vulnerabilities unless their devices are secured through encryption. It is our belief that strong encryption is necessary to protect the privacy and security of individuals, businesses and government actors who use the internet, and this is especially true for groups which lack social power such as women and other marginalised communities. Any weakening of encryption standards would leave us all vulnerable to misuse of our personal data and communications by bad actors including malicious hackers, organised criminals, terrorist groups and hostile nation states.

Concerned by this development after it was brought to our notice by an [**IFF Forum Member**](https://forum.internetfreedom.in/t/yet-another-call-for-e2e-backdoors/1444), we filed Right to Information requests with the Ministries of Home Affairs, External Affairs and Electronics & IT asking them about India’s involvement in the Statement.  


In a [**reply**](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1KVErwO-PbDIliYeVfWF8EANk3D7Er-d9/view?usp=sharing) dated November 13, 2020, the Central Public Information Officer & Legal Officer of the Ministry of External Affairs’ Legal & Treaties Division, Mr. Sudheer K.J., has stated that,  


>*“... we could neither trace any records under the jurisdiction of this CPIO nor could identify any other public authority which may possess related information pertaining to the subject matter of the query...”.*  


This response as well as a failure to identify other relevant public authorities to transfer the application to is indicative of either one of two situations. First, information under the RTI act is being withheld with respect to a matter that squarely falls within the ambit of public interest. Or, second, there is an absence of a proper coordination or consultation with the principal ministerial office, i.e. the Ministry of External Affairs as to an international statement. Either inference is troubling since the statement undermines the fundamental right to informational privacy that is preserved through end-to-end encryption.  


In the first situation, we urge for immediate disclosure and in the second urge for greater coordination between the ministerial offices within the Union Government to examine the reasons and state them publicly on what prompted it’s assent to this international statement. Here, it should be noted that that in the unlikely outcome that assent to this statement was not on the basis of proper consultation within government offices, an urgent review must be conducted and a rights based assessment may be adopted after obtaining a legal opinion on the consistency of this international statement with the constitutional articulation of the fundamental right to privacy.

Programming/coding (or app development) is also a very important part of economy and that is how China got us in the bag. There apps like tik tok or pubg were used highly by us. No problem, good apps must be used.  If you like it, then use. But what I mean to say is that in our country many raw talent minds are there who can be potential developers and boost the GDP of our country. However their dreams and talents are suppressed by the conservative thoughts of their parents who want their child to perform good in schools. However I can understand that you are afraid that what if your child fails in software development and then stay unemployed. Let me ask you what if your child fails in studies? Everyone is not the same, good had given us different abilities for some reason to work as a team. Let him take the risk. There will be more chances of success. China also made and sent apps and increased their GDP. Also eSports and gamers and other kind of youtubers and streamers make a lot of money like 'Tyler Belvins' and 'Michael Grzeseik' . So pls Today go home from office and ask what your child likes.  My parents will not do that so my life is miserable but pls don't let this happen to your child's life. Understand what he wants to become(dancer, singer youtuber, technician, gamer etc.) Understand him and help him achieve his dream. Together we can improve our country as well as the standard of citizens. As more GDP = MORE things for poor.

I would ask them unexpectedly what they meant by that cry,  who was this Bharat Mata, Mother India, whose victory they  wanted? My question would amuse them and surprise them, and  then, not knowing exactly what to answer, they would look at  each other and at me. I persisted in my questioning. At last a 
vigorous Jat, wedded to the soil from immemorial generations,  would say that it was the dharti, the good earth of India, that  they meant. What earth? Their particular village patch, or all  the patches in the district or province, or in the whole of India?  And so question and answer went on, till they would ask me  impatiently to tell them all about it. I would endeavour to do 
so and explain that India was all this that they had thought,  but it was much more. The mountains and the rivers of India, 
and the forests and the broad fields, which gave us food, were  all dear to us, but what counted ultimately were the people of 
India, people like them and me, who were spread out all over  this vast land. Bharat Mata, Mother India, was essentially these 
millions of people, and victory to her meant victory to these  people. You are parts of this Bharat Mata, I told them, you are 
in a manner yourselves Bharat Mata, and as this idea slowlysoaked into their brains, their eyes would light up as if they 
had made a great discovery.","So apparently the great unwashed who had just gained freedom had no idea what India was, and it had to be explained to them in simple terms until their brains could ""soak it in"".

So it was Nehru who decided what India was, not the people, who apparently were clueless what they had fought for.

Jeez, it makes India sound like a corporation founded by Nehru. Which I suppose legitimises handing the reins over to his descendants after him.

We're probably the only large power in the world which is NOT expansionist. We just want to keep our home safe, and not capture other areas to spread the idea of India to others.

Bharat Mata is the land of our gods and ancestors, protected by the Himalayas to the North and the East, the oceans to the South, and the rivers and passes to the west. Our mythologies like the Ramayana involve complex cartography defining the land. Rama didn't annex Sri Lanka, he left the locals to rule it.

Even Alexander the Great learned this lesson the hard way. The Indus was the border for every other civilisation.

Pakistan is an idea. India, like Israel, is a place. With an idea, but not just limited to it. It's a civilisation, and those are generally referred to by their geographic identities.

Poonia needs media training. If you see from a non-biased lens, he does use politically incorrect lingo and unlawful disclosure of private info. making his credibility shaky.

**EDIT:**

To build a case against a money-loaded corporate company who has ability to have access to best legal team with one click, a little bit of political correctness, high moral ground, wise usage of words and smart comebacks while being lawful is necessary.

Next time, the media interviews should be avoided or scripted or just say -

>""My lawyer has advised to not comment on a few things, but rest assured the truth will prevail. I'm confident in my relentless campaign unearthing the truth, the ability of my lawyer, faith on the judicial system and hundreds of other online activists from the startup ecosystem who are unconditionally supporting me and my selfless cause without being afraid of WhiteHatJr's scare tactics. I am the voice of people that WhiteHatJr mutes online"".

**EDIT:**

Instead of referring to Slack, he could have said this:

>Mr. Bajaj has himself admitted that they used a fictional persona of a kid to fool parents. Also, he may have raised a women issue saying ""Pradeep is defaming women teachers."" There is evidence showing showing Karan or his team making misogynistic comments. I cannot share sources of such evidence on this news channel but they will be presented at the court.

**EDIT:**

Regarding Poonia's words ""housewives"", he should come out and justify that housewives can be educated too. He can say:

>If the company thinks housewives are any less educated, that means they are undermining crores of Indian women / housewives who are well-educated. However, when I used the word it was open to interpretation. I was referring to those that do not come from a technical background to be able to teach coding. They read out a script given by WhiteHatJr. I had a problem with that hence I raised the point. My statements had no intent to defame the company, I was simply stating the facts in black and white.

**EDIT:**

**Whatever I write is not legal advice and it shouldn't be taken as final. It is just a starting point and work towards making it fool proof and undebatable.**

Since a few days ago though, I started noticing low internet speeds (≈300KB/s). The surprising part was that whenever a download or a stream started the speed would be upto 2MB/s and then throttle down after a few seconds, the result? All internet speed checks would show 2MB/s speeds (I think this is done on purpose to portray an image of a better network when it's actually not)

The first time I complained, I was told there was network congestion due to usage and it'll get better after while, the next day I was told there's no problem and hence no need for a fix. Waited a couple of days more and things didn't get better.

Being fed up I decided to impulse buy a Vodafone postpaid sim that had an unlimited internet plan (I need really high volume data for work). And after a couple of days I really don't know why people (including me) hated Vodafone so much, it's clearly better than jio and cheaper Airtel.

So why do you guys think Vodafone is inferior?

And if you have a Vodafone Sim  on an Android device and face issues some apps not loading, try changing the APN to ""iphone"" from ""www"", I had that issue but using the iphone APN seems to have fixed everything.

Still of many of us refer to her as Italian, Italian agent etc. Now imagine Americans referring to Harris as Indian agent, spy etc. How would it look?  I can't understand this hypocrisy amongst us. A person who is an American by birth (whose mother voluntarily gave up Indian citizenship) is someone who we should be proud of (and we should be proud of Satya Nadella and Sundar Pichai too although they gave up Indian citizenship to become Americans). We are trying to prove the Indianness of these American citizens on one hand and on the other trying to prove the Italianness of an Indian citizen. A woman who voluntarily choose India and became an Indian through her life and work is someone who we should be ashamed of and suspicious of. I see Sonia Gandhi as more Indian than Harris or Nadella or Pichai but the hatred towards her is a marker of the level of xenophobia among Indians (who cry about white xenophobia while obscuring the same amongst themselves).",Two very different things. ,2020-11-08 22:40:45
970,WhiteHatJr Lady Director is harassing me with false harassment allegations and Legal threats.,je0e98,india,4419,False,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/je0e98/whitehatjr_lady_director_is_harassing_me_with/,288,Non-Political,"After The Ken and Morning Context published their articles, WhiteHatJr and Byjus stopped putting down my videos. But they are still putting down videos of other people, in a much more aggressive and rampant manner. If your videos or posts go down, please let me know about them. I want to keep a track of every single content they are taking down.

So when they couldn't put down my videos, they restored to harassment. I started getting messages (from WhiteHatJr teachers, mutual contacts between me and WhiteHatJr) that I must back out before EOD else they will file a defamation case against me. This felt real and tbh intimidating to some extent.

Then from WhiteHatJr One Lady Director (let's call her WOLD) started giving me legal threats over LinkedIn. She claims I somehow harassed her. I took my elder brother's suggestion to not reply to her threats and kept doing what I was doing. So for 6 days, I didn't reply to her comments. But she just didn't stop, started calling me *'a coward', 'a\*\*', 'doesn't have guts'* for not replying to her comments.

I somehow stayed calm and didn't respond to her threats. She kept saying she would file a case over me for defamation and harassment, and that I will get a legal notice in a week's time.

Meanwhile, Karan Bajaj, CEO of WhitehatJr posted two articles on LinkedIn, in both, he tried to divert the topic and ignored all the questions and concerns that were raised. He basically used his daughter's example to point out that coding is a good tool to enhance learning (no one objected to coding as a part of the curriculum) and in the second one he gave the example of his mother, an army officer's wife, a total emotional route he took there. And somehow justified all the false advertisements of WhitehatJr.

There were some people on LinkedIn who were opposing WhiteHatJr and suddenly they started talking nice things about WhiteHatJr. This was alarming to me. I saw how they were trying to press the issue and move on. And on my posts, WOLD kept instigating me. She even made a new Twitter account to push me more, she kept saying she will file a complaint against me kept calling me a coward.

Finally, I confronted her over LinkedIn comments and told her that I am not scared of her false allegations. I said I am waiting for your legal notice, **TO THIS SHE SAID "" I am letting you go on Humanity grounds'.**

For an entire week she threatened me, bullied me over LinkedIn and Twitter, their teachers called me 'dog' (yes they did), their trollers started calling me 'Pakistani guy' over youtube comments. But when I faced her she had no reply! IN FACT, she started tagging LinkedIn and Twitter telling them that I am bullying her by tagging her in comments.

This was too much for me to ignore. I collected all the snapshots of her threats, made an article on LinkedIn, documenting how she bullied me with her threats for an entire week. AND GUESS What happens next?

My article went down from LinkedIn within 8 hours! AND she disabled her LinkedIn account.

I reposted the article ALONG with the proof of how they suppress dissent, a snapshot of a post by WOLD on Workplace telling their 13k teachers to report my post. This is how they tackle dissent by attacking like a mob, putting baseless false allegations, threatening, and bullying, getting content removed like it's nothing.

Till now they haven't replied to a single question of mine.

\-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

FAQ: Why am I doing this?

Won't go much into my personal life. In short:

* Kota Coaching life. I know what happens there. How aspirations are turned into a rat race. I have also seen Bansal Classes, the most formidable institute of its time going down. Whitehatjr and Byjus are nothing in front of that.
* IIT. Did it even though I never wanted to do engineering. I like other subjects more. Society makes people run after silly tags.
* Software job. I know no one gets a 150 crore salary, I also know coding cant be learned the way WhiteHatJr is trying to teach. Maths and coding cant be learned by spoon-feeding. Only intrinsic desire to learn it can make someone a good coder, not extrinsic rewards such a salary or tags. WhiteHatJr will just create a huge crowd of below-average coders who won't even be employable.
* EdTech Company experience: 8 months of exp (2017) in one such EdTech company showed me how ugly this sector is. There is no education and no tech, only sales and marketing. CEO of that company clearly said in a meeting ""we are not in the education business, we are in money-making business"". I left that company then.
* UPSC preps: I know what kind of depression follows after such failures. I missed Interview calls twice by a single digit, one time by 9 marks, and next time by 8 marks. I feel I have seen the darkest days and somehow came out of it. As an adult, I think I can comprehend how it would feel to a 13-year-old when his/her pipe dream of 150 crore salary (just like wolf Gupta) would break. Teenagers are most prone to depressions. WhiteHatJr can put an entire generation into life long depression.

\-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

PS: Hey WhiteHatJr, I used WOLD and not her name because of the Reddit rules, not scared of you jerks.

### Tl;dr

Last week, we sent a legal notice to the Central Information Commission on behalf of RTI activist and independent journalist, Saurav Das. The legal notice challenges the CIC's refusal to let Mr. Das attend the show cause hearing in his complaint which seeks action against government officials who claim to have no information about the creation of the Aarogya Setu app . The show cause hearing is scheduled for November 24, 2020 i.e. tomorrow and government officials from MeitY, NeGD and NIC have been summoned to explain why they should not be penalized under the RTI Act for obstructing access to information by providing evasive replies. Denying a complainant the right to attend proceedings in his own case is a gross violation of principles of natural justice and such actions go against the letter and spirit of the RTI Act.

### Background

On August 01, 2020, RTI activist and independent journalist, Saurav Das filed RTIs with the Ministry of Electronics & Information Technology (MeitY) and its National E-Governance Division (NeGD) seeking information about the creation of the Aarogya Setu app. The RTI applications sought a copy of the entire file relating to Aarogya Setu which would contain information about the origin of the proposal, people and government departments involved, correspondence between private sector executives and government officials, file notings, minutes of meetings etc.

On September 10, 2020, Mr. Das filed a complaint before the Central Information Commission (CIC) because the public information officers of MeitY and NeGD failed to provide any meaningful reply to his RTI applications. Prior to this, the National Informatics Centre (NIC) had also stated that it does not have any information about Aarogya Setu. An urgent hearing was held before the CIC on October 22, 2020 because the Aarogya Setu app could affect the privacy of millions of Indians during the COVID-19 pandemic and irreversible harm would be caused if the usual wait time of 2 years was insisted upon.

During this hearing on October 22, 2020, the CIC heard Mr. Das's submissions about the conduct of government officials who were providing evasive responses about Aarogya Setu to frustrate RTI applicants. When questioned by the CIC, public information officers from MeitY, NeGD and NIC could not explain which government department held all information related to creation of Aarogya Setu. In its interim order, the CIC held that denial of information by government authorities in such manner could not be accepted and while files may move between departments, *""a citizen cannot go round in circles to find out the custodian.""*

### Violation of principles of natural justice

The interim order issued by the CIC directed public information officers from MeitY, NeGD and NIC to appear for a show cause hearing on November 24, 2020 to explain why penalty under Section 20 of the RTI Act should not be imposed on them for prima facie obstruction of information and providing an evasive reply. The CIC also directed the public information officers to send copies of all documents they intend to rely upon during the hearing at least five days in advance.

Despite multiple requests, the CIC has denied the complainant, Mr. Das permission to attend the show cause hearing scheduled on November 24, 2020 and he has not been provided access to the documents being submitted by government officials either.  In response to his requests, the Registry has merely stated  that the show cause hearing is a *“matter between the Commission and the respondents and the presence of the complainant is not required.”*  Mr. Das has not been provided the video conferencing details for the show cause hearing, and was instead told that a copy of the order issued by the CIC would be shared with him after the show cause hearing was over. However, the order issued by the CIC may not reflect the entirety of the submissions made by government officials before it, and there would be no way for Mr. Das to reply to any contentions taken in real time.

Denying a complainant the right to attend proceedings in his own case is a gross violation of principles of natural justice and such actions go against the letter and spirit of the RTI Act. Furthermore, Mr. Das has not been provided access to the material being submitted by government officials to the CIC, which has severely hampered his ability to prosecute his complaint. Unless he is provided access to the written and oral submissions made by the government officials, he cannot ascertain the veracity of their justifications or rebut their claims by producing contrary evidence.

### Legal notice to the Commission

On November 19, 2020, we sent a legal notice to the CIC on behalf of Mr. Das which emphasized that the RTI Act 2005 and the RTI Rules 2012 do not contain any provision which would support the Registry's stance. In fact, Rule 12 of the RTI Rules 2012 actually requires the CIC to provide a hearing to appellants through video conferencing. The legal notice further notes that while undertaking any kind of quasi-judicial action or administrative action with civil consequences, authorities must comply with principles of natural justice and provide the aggrieved person access to relevant material and a meaningful opportunity to be heard.

In view of the above, the legal notice seeks immediate course correction by the CIC and raises the following three demands:

1. Allow Mr. Das to attend the show cause hearing scheduled on 24 November 2020 by sharing venue details for the video conferencing or the video conferencing link.
2. Provide Mr. Das access to all written material submitted by government officials to the CIC in relation to his complaint and the show-cause notice issued by the CIC.
3. Refrain from taking any final decision about Mr. Das’s complaint without providing him an opportunity to be heard.

### RTI activist, Saurav Das's view

IFF was able to assist Mr. Das with this legal notice and here is what he had to say about this headline grabbing case which has implications for the privacy of millions of Indian citizens.

>“In any democracy if the makers of a heavily marketed government app are unknown, it would cause a huge uproar. The same happened in India when the CIC lambasted the central govt for failing to provide me details about the making of this app. Since then, the NIC and Ministry have been submitting information to the CIC in response to the show cause notice in my case. However, it has been wrapped in secrecy. So much so that even I am not being allowed to witness my own case. It is extremely important that the Appellant or complainant is allowed to witness his own case proceedings to ensure that the concerned officers do not mislead the Commission into believing something that may not be entirely true. The right to rebut their points is my legal right and will only help the Commission reach a fair decision. But a failure to do so is nothing short of a violation of principles of natural justice and is adverse to my case. I have been told this is their normal way of operating. I am shocked that nobody has challenged this arbitrary, illegal, opaque system of hearing, ironically, at the transparency commission. This needs to change now.”

I started smoking when I was in ninth grade. And before I knew it, I was hooked. From a couple a week to a pack a day then quickly to nearly 25 cancer sticks a fucking day.

*(For the record, I'll turn 24 this year)*

I knew this was literally killing me. Worse, it was killing my family. My mom and dad. The people who've sacrificed more than I or you could fathom, to give me the privileged life that I live today. Their smiles vanished as they stood helplessly, watching their son smoke his life away.

I was too ashamed to hug my father because I fucking stunk of smoke all the motherfucking time. It was taking everything away from me. I tried to quit cold turkey many a times but couldn't last longer than 1-2 days. But then somebody suggested nicotine patches. I was extremely skeptical at first. But I bought a month's supply.

I received the patches on 9 August and started the very next day after throwing away my lighter and tearing all the cigarettes that I had left. And guess what? It fucking worked. Before I knew it, a week went by with the patches. But then a fear started to grow within me. ""What if I get hooked to the patches?"", I thought to myself. And after 7 days of using the patches, I started day 8 without any patch. That was 17 August. And till date, I haven't used any nicotine product.

Before you ask, yes. I still get urges from time to time. But instead of giving in, I just look into the mirror and tell myself

# ""I am not a smoker anymore.""

My mother was not eating properly for few days and I was consulting a gastroenterologist who suggested a chest CT scan as she was also coughing. The ct scan showed very likely COVID with mild severity.

I got the scan done for my father too which also showed a likely Covid infection with half of the lungs involved.

I did not have the money to deposit 5 lakh for each of them at private hospitals.  Im a dentist. So, I got talking to my medical friends and got both my parents admitted to a govt Covid facility and decided to stay with them as they are of higher age and needed help.

&#x200B;

They did a huge blunder for my father. As I later found out, with 50 percent lungs already involved, he needed inmediate aggressive treatment. Instead, the drs there took it lightly saying he is not showing any symptoms and lets just observe first. They took the swab two days later and by the time the result came, my father O2 saturation started dropping, even the oxygen mask was not enough and they kept him on ventilator. His situation deteriorated further and I regretted by decision to come here. I took help from relatives and got him admitted to a private hospital.

12 days later, he is still recovering and in ICU. I have already paid over 10 lakhs in treatment and this nightmare just does not seem to end.

My mother recovered and is back home and well. Im just emotionally and financially completely devastated.",Consider getting health insurance in future ,2020-11-10 15:47:39

So I thought I'd share a little background about the league. If you'd like to know more and follow more closely, you are always welcome to /r/IndianFootball for discussion, match threads, and everything else. 

#Background

Indian Super League started as a franchise football tournament in 2013, parallel to India's top division I-League. Now you might be wondering how can you have two top level tournaments in one country? Because we are India and that's how we roll! A little more background to the complications of Indian Football in [this detailed post by /u/EnglishHooligan](https://np.reddit.com/r/soccer/comments/7dki7h/201718_indian_super_league_guide/) from 2017-18 season.

#So what does it look like now?

Indian Super League has made significant progress in establishing itself as the top division league now. The roadmap is more clearer now. The league stage winners are eligible to participate in AFC Champions League (Asian equivalent of UEFA Champions League). With the inclusion of two of the oldest clubs in India, SC East Bengal and Mohun Bagan, ISL has firmly established itself as the de facto top league. Currently, the league is closed, but the season 2023-24 onwards, the league will have promotion and relegation. 

#What will current season look like?

This is the first large scale sporting event to take place in India after COVID-19. (Indian Premier League - IPL took place in UAE) Due to COVID-19, all matches will take place without crowd, in bio bubble at three stadiums of Goa. This is unfortunate for fans, but at least it's the resumption of football in India, so that's good news.

1012,Hello r/india ! Please learn from my mistake. I hope I can save at-least one person from these fraudsters,k7oy2n,india,276,False,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/k7oy2n/hello_rindia_please_learn_from_my_mistake_i_hope/,71,Non-Political,"Backstory: I used to work in Chennai and moved to Visakhapatnam during the lockdown. I vacated my house but I left few of my stuff at my friend's house so that I can pick them up later once this shit-fest of 2020 ends. My friend calls me up saying that he wants to vacate the house too just like me and asks me take a decision on what to do with my stuff at his place. I thought about various options and decided to bring back my stuff to Vizag because I wasn't sure when I'll be back to office. 

So I enquire about packers and movers and found out that agarwal packers and movers was hella costly but had a very reputable name. Then I spoke to dtdc packers and movers who quoted me a price of 80/kg which seemed reasonable at the time. We agreed on a time so that my friend would be there to oversee the packing and stuff. 

First red flag:
Couple of people came on 3rd Dec and packed everything and then came the first red flag. They said they forgot the weighing scale and that it's present at the godown. Both me and my friend were really busy with both of us having important meetings(production downtime) and I wasn't really thinking about how anything can go wrong with dtdc being a well know company. So they took all of my stuff without giving any receipt (first red flag)

Second red flag:
This realisation dawned on me that I have no receipt of them taking my stuff and then I called the guy who I was speaking to over the phone and he said, he will send me the bill/receipt in an hour. After an hour, I followed up he said, he's busy, he'll send it tomorrow by 11am. I followed up promptly he sends me a bill for 15.7k which was another red flag because the bill shouldn't have crossed 5k at max according to the rate we discussed. I refused to pay and asked for my stuff back, he said that that can't happen, they have left Chennai and is at a hub. The only option is for me to pay in full. I went back and forth with him and then we came to an aggreement that I was to pay and advance of 10k and that he would provide me a docket number which would allow me to track my stuff online. So I did.

Major Red flag#3: After I paid the amount at around 12 pm 4th dec, he verified he received the payment and that he'll initiate the process in 2-3 hours and send me the link. I called him up and he says, it will get done next day. I called him up again next day, he said it will get done by 1pm. I call him up again at 3pm, he says by EOD he will send the docket number. This was the last time I spoke to him. After that he didn't attend any of my calls. I dug a little deeper into this company as I was freaking out if I fell for a scam and lo and behold, so many further red flags came up: The website which I found the number: [http://www.dtdcpackersmovers.com/](http://www.dtdcpackersmovers.com/) didn't have a secure connection. None of the social media icons actually lead to any valid social media site. That's when I knew I fucked up big time.

Things I lost to this scam:
1. my TV.
2. a table
3. a chair
4. few trekking equipment
5. few clothes
6. kitchenware.
7. My peace of mind(most important of all!)
The total value of the goods is around 1L. I'm not sad that I lost all of these stuff but that I got so fooled so easily and that my trust in people in generally suffered because of this.

I have recorded all of my conversations with this guy and few other people I have spoken to. I have the pictures of the people who came to pick up my stuff and the registered number of pickup truck that they came with. I also have the receipt which has the office address : [receipt!](https://imgur.com/5nVZnNR)

I'm posting this because I'm feeling humiliated and don't want this to happen with anyone else. If anyone has any ideas on how I can get my stuff back I will owe you one _/\_

edit:

Suggestions I have gotten so far:
1. report to godaddy
2. report this to dtdc
3. report to police.

Will start working on 1 and 2 right away. Need help with 3. I don't know if directly going would help. I found a few contacts through which I'm trying. Will keep you guys updated",Please add a TLDR ,2020-12-06 15:00:08

While he was gone, the woman finished her transaction and left. It took another 20 seconds for him to return. I stood there along with another woman behind me out of courtesy for the old man.  When he returned, seeing us waiting, he apologized and thanked us. We greeted him and smiled back. Fair enough

Now it was my turn, as I was reaching to my pocket, 'backassward-ly"" a young man in his teens enters the shop, grabs himself a loaf of bread and stands right in front of me. I froze for a second. It was the most extraordinary transition to an ""unexplored territory"". The cashier herself was visibly irritated. She told him that she was attending to me and that he should fall back in line just like everyone else. He smirked and stood behind; in between the lady and me. I couldn't handle his behavior and flipped. I said to his face, what he was doing was wrong and he should have the least courtesy towards other customers. He had that look in the face which completely describes and ghetto teen filled with cynicism and packed with attitude. 

The woman behind me told me to calm down and let him get over with. I paid for my shit and left.

As I reflect now, there is one thing I realize. If we wish to change the country for the better, it should start from us. At the end of the day, you can only change yourself. As citizens, we must start taking responsibilities and not be those who vocally pledge nationalism, but those who live by the oath in action.",Is this a hate crime? ,2019-09-03 13:09:18

He has gone through all the 18 candidates and their symbols from which he selected one and casted his vote. 


But to his surprise the printed form isn't the one to which he casted his vote.With all depression he came back home and shared this worst situation with me. 


This pissed him off to such an extent that he decided not to vote in his life. 


Where the fuck is democracy?


Where the heck is moral ethics of Election commission of India?


One person vote may or may not differ in this politics. But he lost trust on Indian politics and on these leaders.","This is possible only once a large part of the Indian electorate is educated and becomes aware if the real issues facing them. Until then, voters will largely vote based on caste and religious lines and family legacy. (and of course  promised freebies.) The problem with these criteria is that a candidate then has to spend large amounts of money on his campaign to buy votes. This amount generally exceeds the limits set by the Election Commission and thus is funded and channelled through the ""black"" economy. It probably needs no further explanation that this would mean the candidate is involved in shady deals and probably unlawful activities. This is root of the ""politics is dirty"" legacy in India.
Thus, an intelligent electorate which recognizes the matters the government can actually solve, manage the economy and provide good governance would provide hope to a genuine candidate to actually contest an election and think about winning. Until this occurs, we will have to just be content with choosing between the lesser of the two evils. ",2019-04-14 01:15:19

I absolutely hate discrimination amongst ourselves, I feel it'll hamper our national growth. We are Indians first, and statehood is secondary.

I live in Bangalore and the follwing incident occurred a few weeks ago. I placed an order on Swiggy for lunch. I'm a meat loving foodie, and wanted to try out some of the Kerala restaurants in my area. My order was accepted by the restaurant and the estimated delivery time was around 30 mins.

However, after 30 mins there was no further updates on my order. So I called up the delivery executive (who's name and accent indicated he was from a certain North Indian state). He then told me that one of items I had ordered contained beef, and he wasn't going to deliver my order because it contained beef. 'You don't seem like a muslim why have you ordered beef'. I hung up and contacted customer care and a new delivery agent was assigned, who finally delivered my order after a duration of 1.5 hours.

Now, I have a couple of sensible arguments against this

1) Beef served in Karnataka is Buffalo meat and not Cow meat. Truly a tragedy, not even remotely as tasty as the real deal.


2) I have academically studied ancient Hinduism in university and have conclusive evidence that we both consumed and performed ritual sacrifice of cow.


3) Why tf did you sign up for this job, or even accept my order?

However, I didn't bother explaining logic to this chutiya as I know that his belief system doesn't work on logic.

What really grinds my gears is that we in the South have a pretty tolerant of culture. Hindus and Muslims live side by side, lead their own merry lives and often don't poke their noses into each other's affair. God forbid, I'm not going to be lectured in my own homeland by some hateful bigot in gutkha-impaired speech.

Edit - He outright refused service and he also 'canceled' the order on his end. As a contractor I believe he can cancel orders that he's accepted. Swiggy can't do anything about it except assign a new delivery agent or offer refund.","> I have academically studied ancient Hinduism in university

Please don't lie. I agree that cows were sacrificed and eaten but don't lie man. 

> Beef served in Karnataka is Buffalo meat and not Cow meat. Truly a tragedy, not even remotely as tasty as the real deal.

And you are eating Kerala shit fry or something anyway and not a proper way to eat beef but some shit dripping in coconut oil.

Eat proper food like a delicious medium rare grass-fed rib eye steak and then you'll know the true taste of meat. Eat some filer mignon wrapped in bacon and none of that shit Kerala food.

And excerpt from his book.",k2srvk,india,200,False,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/k2srvk/our_bhakti_channels_that_are_promoting/,14,Non-Political,"There was a very powerful dynasty in Southern India. They made it a rule to take the horoscope of all the prominent men living from time to time, calculated from the time of their birth. In this way they got a record of leading facts predicted, and compared them afterwards with events as they happened. This was done for a thousand years, until they found certain agreements; these were generalised and recorded and made into a huge book. The dynasty died out, but the family of astrologers lived and had the book in their possession. It seems possible that this is how astrology came into existence. *Excessive attention to the minutiae of astrology is one of the superstitions which has hurt the Hindus very much.*

I think the Greeks first took astrology to India and took from the Hindus the science of astronomy and carried it back with them to Europe. Because in India you will find old altars made according to a certain geometrical plan, and certain things had to be done when the stars were in certain positions, therefore I think the Greeks gave the Hindus astrology, and the Hindus gave them astronomy.

*I have seen some astrologers who predicted wonderful things; but I have no reason to believe they predicted them only from the stars, or anything of the sort. In many cases it is simply mind-reading. Sometimes wonderful predictions are made, but in many cases it is arrant trash.*  
In London, a young man used to come to me and ask me, “What will become of me next year?” I asked him why he asked me so. “I have lost all my money and have become very, very poor.” Money is the only God of many beings. Weak men, when they lose everything and feel themselves weak, try all sorts of uncanny methods of making money, and come to astrology and all these things. *“It is the coward and the fool who says, ‘This is fate'” — so says the Sanskrit proverb. But it is the strong man who stands up and says, “I will make my fate.” It is people who are getting old who talk of fate.* Young men generally do not come to astrology. We may be under planetary influence, but it should not matter much to us. *Buddha says, “Those that get a living by calculation of the stars by such art and other lying tricks are to be avoided”; and he ought to know, because he was the greatest Hindu ever born. Let stars come, what harm is there? If a star disturbs my life, it would not be worth a cent. You will find that astrology and all these mystical things are generally signs of a weak mind; therefore as soon as they are becoming prominent in our minds, we should see a physician, take good food and rest.*

*If you can get an explanation of a phenomenon from within its nature, it is nonsense to look for an explanation from outside. If the world explains itself, it is nonsense to go outside for an explanation.* Have you found any phenomena in the life of a man that you have ever seen which cannot be explained by the power of the man himself? So what is the use of going to the stars or anything else in the world? *This I lay down as the first essential in all I teach: anything that brings spiritual, mental, or physical weakness, touch it not with the toes of your feet.*Religion is the manifestation of the natural strength that is in man. A spring of infinite power is coiled up and is inside this little body, and that spring is spreading itself. And as it goes on spreading, body after body is found insufficient; it throws them off and takes higher bodies. This is the history of man, of religion, civilisation, or progress. That giant Prometheus, who is bound, is getting himself unbound. It is always a manifestation of strength, and all these ideas such as astrology, although there may be a grain of truth in them, should be avoided.

There is an old story of an astrologer who came to a king and said, “You are going to die in six months.” The king was frightened out of his wits and was almost about to die then and there from fear. But his minister was a clever man, and this man told the king that these astrologers were fools. The king would not believe him. So the minister saw no other way to make the king see that they were fools but to invite the astrologer to the palace again. There he asked him if his calculations were correct. The astrologer said that there could not be a mistake, but to satisfy him he went through the whole of the calculations again and then said that they were perfectly correct. The king’s face became livid. The minister said to the astrologer, “And when do you think that you will die?” “In twelve years”, was the reply. The minister quickly drew his sword and separated the astrologer’s head from the body and said to the king, “Do you see this liar? He is dead this moment.”

If you want your nation to live, keep away from all these things. The only test of good things is that they make us strong. Good is life, evil is death. These superstitious ideas are springing like mushrooms in your country….

The more I live, the more I become convinced every day that every human being is divine. In no man or woman, however vile, does that divinity die. Only he or she does not know how to reach it and is waiting for the Truth. And wicked people are trying to deceive him or her with all sorts of fooleries. *If one man cheats another for money, you say he is a fool and a blackguard. How much greater is the iniquity of one who wants to fool others spiritually! This is too bad. It is the one test, that truth must make you strong and put you above superstition. The duty of the philosopher is to raise you above superstition…* what infinite souls you are! And to be tricked by twinkling stars! It is a shameful condition. You are divinities; the twinkling stars owe their existence to you.",r/UsernameChecksOut ,2020-11-29 02:27:03

I've been coding ever since I was in 7th grade. I know a lot about software, can code in 

CPP, JAVA/KOTLIN, PYTHON and JAVASCRIPT

Can write Desktop, Android and Web Apps and still learning, good with DS and ALGO. Gonna start competitive programming soon. 

I have really good grasp on everything related to software but don't know shit about electronics except some adruino projects I did.

But my dream is Robotics and AI. I wanna get software related jobs but I also wanna have all the knowledge about electronics to work on my own projects. I'm really passionate about electronics and software both. 

My questions are:

- Is there anyway to do ECE and CSE together? Like is there any dual degree program like that in India? And

- Will it have any negatives if I wanna apply for software related jobs in product based companies?

- Are there any research opportunities available in future for robotics? Can I become a scientist? If yes, how, what path should I take? 

I'm currently in 12th preparing for IIT-JEE. Also, I'm sorry if this question is kinda confusing, I'm kinda stressed out on what should I do next.","For AI, I don't see how ECE is really relevant. You should learn enough from a CSE course about digital circuits, if you really want to do something hands on.

Robotics on the other hand is a multi disciplinary subject, requiring knowledge of mechanical engineering in addition to electronics and computer science. There is a dual degree program in IIT Madras, but it's under the department of Engineering Design, so I think the focus is more on the mechanical side of robotics. But there should be ample coverage of electronics, computer vision, control theory and planning algorithms too. 

IMO, you can start in any of the three branches and go further into robotics in a master's program. Also expect a lot of math to be involved, both in robotics and AI. ",2020-11-11 10:40:05

I have been seeing this from about a month now, when cases in Chhattisgarh started to soar.

Though there are cases, there are not as much cases as the data says. The hospitals and the government is simply over-stating the data to get more financial aid from center.

Though it was supposed to go to the patients so that they can help themselves, the money is actually getting eaten by the authorities and the doctors.

In my district atleast, so many false cases has been reported. They report for mild fever or any other matching symptoms of COVID and the hospital authorities comes and takes them like prisoners.

The people taken away are not allowed go back home. And they are just kept there in the name of treatment.

Several people have described what happens to them in the hospital. They are just kept there, food thrown to them in plastic bags, and given doses of Vitamin C and D tablets with paracetamol and some other medications.

After some days, they are allowed to go home. WITHOUT FURTHER COVID TEST.

Furthermore, each test of COVID is counted as one new patient of virus, even of the person is same, or even if the test result comes out negative.

1058,Why FAU-G is a HOAX? From the perspective of European AAA game developer.,inp9b4,india,349,False,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/inp9b4/why_faug_is_a_hoax_from_the_perspective_of/,69,Science/Technology,"I know there is a huge discussion around this ""Project"". Also controversy that PUBG was banned, and now this thing is being produced. I needed to share my thoughts about this as a AAA game developer.

When a serious game company decides to reveal information about their project they show a teaser that will 'sell' the mood of the game, setting, gameplay, etc. depending of how advanced the production is. Even when is not much to show, they have game design document, rough prototypes of mechanics. One is sure, no real gamedev company uses bought stock content to promote their game.

And here we begin - a **Twitter** post ( [https://twitter.com/vishalgondal/status/1301822102471811074?s=19](https://twitter.com/vishalgondal/status/1301822102471811074?s=19) ).

[Twitter Post](https://preview.redd.it/qjnh29u4ljl51.png?width=585&format=png&auto=webp&s=4bc35e40a2b40eec4dbd304f75cb695431e305f5)

There is absolutely no information about the game. There is one word ""Action Game"" which can define games from Pac Man to Mortal Kombat. Also from other twitter posts we can learn that game will teach about ""sacrifices of our soldiers"". I guess it's about sacrifices of Indian soldiers - so... it is perfectly normal to make a teaser poster of game with stock photo of American Soldiers ( [www.shutterstock.com/image-photo/battle-military-war-troops-smoke-1045196350](https://www.shutterstock.com/image-photo/battle-military-war-troops-smoke-1045196350) ). There is also a word soon - we will get to that later.

So how we know it will be a PUBG clone?

https://preview.redd.it/el7z20kjljl51.png?width=583&format=png&auto=webp&s=6c4d9b3cfde0d7df67e689eefacbf63d172a8546

And that's all info relating to PUBG. But lets assume FAU-G will be actually a PUBG clone.

*EDIT:  It turned out The trailer is probably fake material posted on ncore games YouTube channel. Probably it's not official site. I will still put it in spoiler tag if anyone wants to see it anyway.*

>!After the teaser poster comes TRAILER uploaded at nCORE Games youtube channel ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XXv2jazfXT0 )!<

[Trailer Screenshot](https://preview.redd.it/pcr5c06dmjl51.png?width=1203&format=png&auto=webp&s=0adbbcaf8a5e3b631727261cac5f6bacaeea0b10)

>!And what happened? From modern time USA we jumped to Second World War, in Europe. There is European architecture from those times, guns, vehicles, etc. And people are talking in Polish there ( I was surprised to hear my mother language in Indian game trailer, and this made me intrigued. And here I am, disappointed ). BTW HALT means STOP in German.!<

Conclusions for now - nCORE Games, has absolutely no content and no idea how the game should and will look like. They use stock materials to promote non existing project.

Let's move on and assume they actually know what game they are making. So we will see the **Company Portfolio**, just to see if they can deliver. "" nCore Games - Leading mobile game publishers "" we start good but there aren't any games at all in their portfolio. The team doesn't have ANY game developer, just CEO, COO, Investors, Director..

https://preview.redd.it/lwa7fj9wsjl51.png?width=1228&format=png&auto=webp&s=721b8b523cb72953b53571c61219e773d50a4f16

Site says they are mobile games developer, so lets see Google Play store ( [https://play.google.com/store/apps/developer?id=nCore+Games&hl=en](https://play.google.com/store/apps/developer?id=nCore+Games&hl=en) )

[nCore Games profile on Google Play](https://preview.redd.it/jpbr695etjl51.png?width=1179&format=png&auto=webp&s=7793dbcc858b68254467001835220d674283c03b)

Their profile shows only one game (1.9 rated) which is Unity made Asteroids game clone. I won't say I am surprised.

I have been told that this game falls under ""Make in India"" umbrella. Maybe Vishal Gondal was able to create such crew out of people working in Indian AAA/AA game development studios? I used well known list on Wikipedia to find how many studios are there ( [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List\_of\_video\_game\_developers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_video_game_developers) ).

https://preview.redd.it/67svqc9ovjl51.png?width=1669&format=png&auto=webp&s=e58799f447b51603b1be711e767959e9c8417b84

*EDIT: Thank to your feedback about India AAA Studios, I updated list.*

India AAA Studios:

* Rockstar India (former Dhruva Interactive, Bangalore)
* Ubisoft (Pune, Mumbai)
* Electronic Arts (Hyderabad)

I googled a little to get other lists and found this - [https://www.goodfirms.co/game-development-companies/india](https://www.goodfirms.co/game-development-companies/india). Rest of companies are quite small, not able to create such big project and not experienced enough.

How this game will be made in India and when, if there are only three AAA gamedev companies in India who can make a game that they showed in game trailer? Or they will outsource the game project to any foreign AAA studio under name of Indian nCore company and call it an ""Indian Game"".

Now let me tell you what it takes to make game similar to what they showed in FAU-g teaser.

It is very complex proces that needs time, iteration and good design. Making a AA or AAA game takes years to make. For example Call of Duty game serie has 3 year development cycle. The newest production is made by two huge studios - Raven Software and Treyarch. Treyarch only has 600 people.  ( [https://www.gfinityesports.com/article/2874/call-of-duty-black-ops-cold-war-leaks-release-date-beta-gameplay-trailer-teasers-warzone-multiplayer-zombies-campaign-and-everything-you-need-to-know](https://www.gfinityesports.com/article/2874/call-of-duty-black-ops-cold-war-leaks-release-date-beta-gameplay-trailer-teasers-warzone-multiplayer-zombies-campaign-and-everything-you-need-to-know) )

For PUBG, data say it was process of 1-2 years of development. To release FAU-G 'soon' game would need to be in production for about a year already with a team of not 6 directors but at least 50 developers.

All of this made me think that this game won't be released ever or this won't be a PUBG clone but some simple shooter game, that will be released and forgotten very fast.

\--

&#x200B;

EDIT:  When I started to research about FAU-G  there was only one ""supposed"" nCore games channel on YouTube. The moment I published my post here, I noticed there are hundreds of bots nCore accounts created on YT within an hour. I'm surprised, why ?

EDIT2: Typos, Updated with feedback.

*EDIT: Thank you very much for the awards kind strangers. I really appreciate it. Also thank you for the discussion under the thread and your feedback.*","Hello European aaa developer ! 

Perspective from an indian mobile game developer/publisher to you.


The only thing linking pubg and faug are the name similarities and the announcement of faug came around the time when pubg was banned. No one ever has stated in public domain that the game is a clone of pubg/battle royale. It could be a basic casual shooter game for all we know .

In Europe I'm sure you guys build all your games on your own. In india we did not have a console gaming revolution or PC gaming revolution but we are going through smartphone gaming revolution with close to 500 million smartphone users . So what we have now are a new generation of young gaming startups with limited years of gaming experience when compared to folks in Europe and some foreign developers.The gaming industry talent here is raw and not so experienced like you folks who may be carrying your pc/console gaming experience into the mobile gaming domain. 

If ncore wants to do a pubg clone it's still possible  As claimed by ncore games on their website, they do original IP and third party publishing. My guess is that rather than developing ( for the reasons stated by you) they may go the publisher route by partnering with some foreign studio who may have already developed a fps battle royale. Buy rights to code, then create new assets - players , maps and may be Ul/uX redesign and voila , u have ur own indian fps battle royale game. Publish the game in your name and share revenues with the original developer. This strategy is not new and has been done even by basic seed round funded Indian gaming startups . For example there is a startup called Flixy Games[n](https://yourstory.com/2016/09/flixy-games-seed-funding) which partnered with foreign game developers to get access to their game code base and do suitable modifications like art assets, backgrounds and even storyline to create an indian game feel. If thse guys with a small team can do it, so can ncore by just creating new art assets and background and ui modification. art work can be outsourced to multiple studios . So basically, it is possible to create a new game in a much shorter time.

There is so much news to digest around the vaccine that I am genuinely lost. First up, there are several candidates & how which one gets the nod notwithstanding the storage feasibility and all, the question that I want to focus on is, ""When & how will the Indian people be vaccinated?""

Snippets from all news reports/feeds that I have seen at least:

1. \*\*The government never said that all Indians will get the vaccine.\*\**Funny. A certain election promise was that the party if voted to power, will get you the vaccine*
2. \*\*The government aims to vaccinate 30 crore high priority people by July 2021.\*\**Okay. That makes sense that the people most at risk get it first. Hope that the people that make the cut are genuinely high priority*
3. \*\*Phase II will cover 80 crore Indians (\~60% of the population)\*\**When? How? Which?*
4. **The SII says that the vaccine should be available in the private market (for e.g., for corporations that wish to get its staff vaccinated) by March 2021/April 2021***So, if I don't make the cut of the 30 crore high priority Indians, can I get the vaccine in May 2021 from a private label? Sounds wrong. Also, who will regulate the cost and the genuineness of the distributor? Imagine the black market then*
5. **The UP government has been ordered to get its vaccination process ready by 15th December 2020 to vaccinate 77 districts***What alternate universe timeline is this?*
6. **The Delhi government claims that it can vaccinate the entire city of Delhi in 1 month***I am lost*
7. **How will the government make efforts to ensure if someone is vaccinated or not? I mean, is Aadhar compulsory? And how can I trust that the person that I am meeting is vaccinated or not apart from their word for it?**

The more I read, the more scared I get that this is going to be handled as well as demonetisation was. The people involved might have everyone's best interests at heart and I know that this is a defining time that is new to a lot of people. But, we as a country have seen the impact that bad communication or partial communication can have on people (ref: long queues outside stores when the lockdown was announced & the whole migrant movement then).

1081,[RANT] Life is unpredictable and shit can happen anytime unexpectedly.

Its portrayed in a light hearted way and I've never thought of it as nothing but a joke till yesterday.

My grand-uncle(59) was a retired govt employee and used his life savings to buy a plot of land in his hometown and constructed a large house for his family(mother, wife, son, daughter),   
the house warming was last week and most of our relatives were jealous of his achievement and there were curses and talks of trying to claim their share by registering a legal case.

He had planned to move into the new house today, yesterday he went out to buy some equipment and got hit by an asshole who was drunk driving, that motherfucker ran straight to the police station and surrendered, leaving him lying on the road with a head injury, it was 45 mins before anyone found him and took him to the hospital, but by then it was too late

Today was the funeral and it broke my heart seeing him laid down in the grand house he had built.   
He wanted to move there and life a great retired life with his family. His mother is still alive she's nearing 90, he wanted to take care of her till her last breath.  
I've seen my share of deaths but this one hit me the hardest and I can never see that comedy scene the same way again.",Sorry for your loss. Anyway can you provide more details about the size of the house? How man rooms? Floors etc? ,2020-11-30 03:19:23

* 📖 Giveaway [Part 3]

After launching two successful book giveaways — first [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/9z3lxo/hello_i_am_giving_away_free_copies_of_1984_by/), and second [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/a22a3v/hello_i_am_giving_away_free_copies_of_animal_farm/) — and getting tremendous responses by everyone, I decided to do this more often. Although I am planning to make this a monthly thing, but this would require some time to set it up. I'll've to arrange proper channels to ease the process, and have more transparency and automation. I am already on it, and I think we can start off this by January! 😃

I asked for suggestions for this giveaway, and I got loads of it! Most requested books were *'Brave New World by Aldous Huxley'* and *'Fahrenheit 451 by Ray Bradbury.'* So I thought of going with any one of them for this giveaway, but then there were issues with Amazon's Limited Quantity policy, and sellers. There are not many PRIME sellers for those books, and the sellers who are, have limited quantity filter applied. I've talked with those sellers to help me out, and they did explain me how I can bypass this filter and order books in those high quantities (200+)

Long story short, it would take some time to arrange all of that, and I am already on it, so we'll be able to do those books too, along with the others that came in suggestions, from January! So stay tuned if you're interested in those books.

Meanwhile, for this giveaway, I selected two of my all time favorite books:

**The Prophet by Kahlil Gibran**

**Metamorphosis by Franz Kafka**

On The Prophet: You have to read Gibran more than once to fully digest it. I think this book is amazing, with some really beautiful illustrations! I am not a religious person, but this classic, if digested properly, would appeal to any reader regardless of his/her present, absent or muddled religious beliefs. Despite your religious views, Gibran has given us a work of beauty that proves, that faith is not necessary to be good and right. This is not a holy book, but this is holier than the other so-called holy books! To be honest, I first picked this book, when I learned that Friedrich Nietzsche's 'Thus Spoke Zarathustra' was the inspiration behind The Prophet! This intrigued me first, and I am so glad that I picked this up.

On Metamorphosis: I first read this book in one sitting, and I remember how it stayed on my mind for long time. I've always loved reading Sartre, Camus, Beauvoir, and Kierkegaard, the most prominent of Existentialist Philosophers. Personally, I think it was a turning point in my life; it was not gradual, it was an epiphany, the 'why', the realization of the sheer absurdity of things. This is a powerful work, and one of the best in Existentialist literature. I mean it carves the path, you have to contemplate on it. The blend of absurd, surreal and mundane which gave rise to the adjective ""Kafkaesque."" This is a must read!

Quotes from the books:
> “I cannot make you understand. I cannot make anyone understand what is happening inside me. I cannot even explain it to myself.” 

> ""And forget not that the earth delights to feel your bare feet and the winds long to play with your hair.""

---

🎄 **Surprise elements:** The Christmas is ahead, so I'm also including a little surprise element! Along with these two books, please add some more books, that you'd like to read, that were recommended by your friends and family, or the one that you always wanted to read! I will randomly select, and surprise you! 🎅🏼

- Dhoni doesn't retire post WC, this raises a lot of eyebrows - obviously he is 38, there are better replacements and this is the time to try out new players

- Statement from Rhiti Sports(Dhoni owned and manages him and other CsK) and later on selection panel that Dhoni would not be retiring and rather doing a 2 month stint with the army. Lot of people are surprised by this and don't understand the timing of this post WC.

- In the immediate few days after this,  Audit report of Amrapali group is analysed as part of SC case against the group. Audit trail shows a clear nexus between group and Rhiti Sports, where homebuyers's money has been siphoned off to his wife, Sports Agency and now news even linking the bcci head Shashank Manohar (What??)

- [Side Event] Byjus announced as new jersey sponsor replacing Oppo. No Tender or process for jersey sponsor had been allowed, but just an announcement of Byjus (of all companies) to be jersey sponsor for BCCI. 

## Conclusion

- If you read between the lines, this was a well timed move by Sports Agency or Dhoni to announce the Army stint before the Amrapali Sham comes out to the media. Also most likely the reason for not retiring so can still call a few shots if this goes south (refer to the ipl fixing issue). How far is the bcci involved is anyone's guess with their shady crony practices? 

- Just another thing to bring home the point is none of the other Indian player greats including Sachin, Yuvraj, Sehwag, Clean as hell Dravid, Ganguly have over courted as many controversies as Dhoni. The clout that Dhoni holds is enough for him to walk on to the pitch in IPL even if he was not the fielding team, nor batting and get away with 50% fee fine, that should tell you how muddy our cricket world is (Byjus and all the above). 

- Meanwhile the match starts on Aug3 and we all go India...India with ads of Dream 11 and Godaddy after every over, khelo dimag se my friends","Ahh it’s nothing to has to do about dhoni.

I'm from Lahore, Pakistan. Since my childhood, unlike lot of people around me, I always had a huge fascination with India. I always visualize India as an entity full of energy, passion, dreams. faith and an inspiration. To me it's not a country, it's a feeling which gives me adrenaline rush everytime I think about it. I've subscribed Indian content (of almost all types) and follow it regularly. I'm huge fan of Indian music, cricket and much more.

Given the slight more knowledge I've about India than many people around me in Pakistan, I've been labelled as 'Raw agent' many times by many of my friends in a lighter note. I work in Lahore and from 16th floor from my workstation I look at Ferozpur road that goes straight to Ferozpur, India.  One of my biggest wish in life,  if not the biggest one is to visit India, explore it and make great friends there. From Kashmir to Kerala, Gujrat to Arunchal Pradesh, I want to dissolve myself into the cultural diversity of India. To me, India is most unique of all countries containing satisfying diversity within.

It really is disappointing sometimes to imagine that I won't be able to visit India :( My sister told me to keep faith and I'll be able to visit it one day. I really hope one day, one day maybe. Idk if you get this, it's intangible feeling associated with India I'm passionate about. Probably the closest relatable explanation of Johnty Rhodes naming her daughter ""India"".

1115,UP Draft Bill on Freedom of Religion,k0r2ks,india,63,True,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/k0r2ks/up_draft_bill_on_freedom_of_religion/,8,Policy/Economy,"I'm from UP, I read the Bill, and here are some concerns:

1. &#x200B;

[Section 3](https://preview.redd.it/tdgmdbtydd161.png?width=811&format=png&auto=webp&s=c091561c4e4f1f9ef03867f7282a25bf902f727a)

Main issue is with the term ""allurement"". Definition of Allurement in section 2(a)

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/zk936aqfed161.png?width=795&format=png&auto=webp&s=31bc211b50dcb6a4d4450a440215ec29157fb837

Primary concern is that this will be misused to target dalits and bahujans who adopt Budhism to escape structural caste based discrimination, marginalisation and violence from Hindus. This phrase is just vague enough for sanghi vigilantes to file FIRs. 

2**. Exception for reconversion to ""previous religion""**. This is found in other state's similar legislations (for ex. Jharkhand permits return to ""ancestor's religion""). This is a sneaky little way to allow for all the ghar wapasi/shuddhi. Sanghis love to argue that everyone in this country was once ""hindu"".

**3. Who can file a complaint? Literally ANYBODY.** 

https://preview.redd.it/6gq73lffgd161.png?width=763&format=png&auto=webp&s=7f3a78b485796a78eb73948b34f7c75ba3949019

Freedom of Religion (Article 25, Constitution of India) is a personal right. How is a lay person allowed to lodge complaint? What does ""aggrieved"" mean? Why is the locus standi so wide?

4. Declaration to DM one month before conversion from the person trying to convert and the religious priest undertaking the ceremony:

https://preview.redd.it/x69q4l4lid161.png?width=774&format=png&auto=webp&s=bc5cbbdc5dced7a4ee8c947521dd0f036f783539

Concern: Information can be leaked and publicized. Minority community and Budhist orgs converting dalits will be particularly at risk. One month is a long and sufficient time to intimidate and harass. Even after submitting the Declaration, the DM will conduct a police verification. 

https://preview.redd.it/s3wt3xo7jd161.png?width=764&format=png&auto=webp&s=f9633867e187f991300d7c4c9b466504403e0b9d

As long as there is a BJP sarkaar in UP, this is an additional tool for intimidation. 

In case anyone had any misconceptions here are more tools for intimidation:

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/kpbrk3w3kd161.png?width=795&format=png&auto=webp&s=0b83524bb649cbff9939716dd1d1df0e95f4d270

5. Who all can be punished under this Act:

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/03nf2bdpkd161.png?width=775&format=png&auto=webp&s=2fc4a1479377a65d4257195ef47c6719f0326b81

Again, frighteningly broad ambit of who all can be booked under this Act. FRIGHTENINGLY BROAD. What does ""counsel"" and ""convince"" mean? If my friend wants to convert, talks to me about it, and I tell her to follow her heart, have I ""counselled"" or ""convinced"" her? I am a criminal now?

6. **Burden of Proof on the accused:** Normally (there can be exceptions if statues provide for them) in criminal law, whoever lays a claim must present evidence or proof. So if a random person alleges that A converted in contravention of this law, burden of proof has to be on this random person. But instead, A now has to prove his innocence. In other words, MORE HARASSMENT.

&#x200B;

1. Hi, unlike most Indian redditors I didn't go to a school in a metro city, I grew up in rural part of country and since childhood I had very limited female interaction because of the gender ratio in rural areas. I'm genuinely willing to understand what to actually talk when you meet a girl for the first time IRL. Most of the conversations are usually done online and I seriously don't know what others talk.
2. I'm in my early twenties and a shy guy, once a girl (not a date) asked me out, but I refused because am shy and not gonna lie, I kinda felt intimidated by just thinking about how awkward it would be for me to meet a girl in real life. There have been similar instances. On a contrary, am someone who loves to network with people and have met lot of guys online and then connected with them IRL through conferences, meetups etc, but when it comes to girls am very shy.

Honestly, this is only when it comes to meet them f2f. I can hold decent conversations with them online/chats, provided we connect on any aspect of life. When I connect with someone, conversations naturally flows and it goes on and on regardless of the gender (online) am talking to, but unfortunately that's not the case with me when f2f with a girl. I just can't hang out with them with full confidence like I would with a guy I met online.

I asked some of my guy friends who are good in dating etc, and they gave me this standard answer ""Bhai tu jse ldko se bat krta h wse hi krna hota h aur kya h isme"" (Brother, you have to talk to them just like you would talk to any guy) but this is easy for them to say, not that easy for me.

It's not like I can't even utter a single word in front of them, that's a extreme situation to be in. It's just that I don't feel that I'm in full confidence like the way I am when with a guy, am kinda award when with a girl, you get my point right? This could be mainly because of less female interaction while growing up.

I knew that I may mess up in first few dates, but will eventually learn and get out of this fear/shyness/awkwardness, but covid ruined everything.

Please share your experiences if you have seen someone like me or know someone like me who got out of this, serious answers please.","Your friend is totally right about it. It's not that you are socially conscious. It's that you have yet to accept it completely that women are all different and you're someone's type. What are you exactly afraid o f? She won't like you, reject the potential relationship (or vice versa), you can have a drink to soothe yourself, and move on. You don't have to get GET anything out of that first conversation other than getting to know her name, particular thing she likes, some commonality and random thoughts exchange. Just like it's with new male friends or online. You might've liked something about her other than her physical appearance.

Best of two offer for the first time has been announced for college for students giving ISA, leaving us in dilemma to go to campus or not. 2nd ISA is currently happening in campus.
Labs have also been made offline.

2) ESA is scheduled in December MANDATORY IN OFFLINE MODE. For the namesake of giving option, they have given us a chance to either give it in December or in next semester along with that semester exams. It is almost impossible for a student to give 2 semesters' exam together. So practically it's not an option and forcibly all of us have to give exams in December in campus. 

3) When most other colleges have much before declared that all of their college activities would happen via online mode, PES has chosen not to even consider the option. A huge number of students study here and from all across India which makes it very difficult as well as risky to go to college.

4)  Since August, Hostel Management have taken decisions that are not student-friendly. Today most students have paid the hostel fees and are in hostel right now. No SOP is being followed in the hostel, students are sharing rooms, attendance daily and mess coupons distribution weekly through queueing or grouping. No social distancing is being followed/enforced.

5) Consent form is being taken from student's parents but the form is very unclear. It talks about classes but not exams however, the exams are the issue. College clearly wants to force people to make a decision but not have any liability on themselves. 

6) College is allowing students to enter even WITHOUT COVID TEST report. People are even producing month old tests which college is encouraging/ accepting. There have been numerous incidents where students are gathering as they believe college is taking precautions. There is no enforcement of Social Distancing either.

7) Covid Testing was done on the college campus in one location with no social distancing. However one student from that area has tested positive and many students are yet to get their results, yet college is still allowing them to write their exams. The college has been completely ignorant about the fact and does not respond to us. 

8) Since a long time, we students are trying to contact our college management and convey our concerns. But each time they neglect us. There has been minimum communication whereas, during a pandemic, it should be ample. The only communication is a monthly live session where they have a one-way conversation with the students. 

9) Parents and students have sent mails across to our higher management as well which have been ignored. There has also been a case where one student received a reply in error where the pro-chancellor has asked the faculty to ignore the mail and ""move it to spam""

All these things have led to a lot of fear among students and parents. It is adamantly clear that the management is not following the SOP's in place and therefore are putting our health at risk. 
 Students have to travel all across from India risking their lives just to write exams when there is an alternate option available (online), which is being taken by other colleges. The Covid situation in Bangalore is not very good. We have seen and even have photos of people gathering in college but college authority takes no action regarding it.
The entire student community is very tensed right now. People living away from home are afraid of what to do if something were to happen to them. 

The entire student community of PES UNIVERSITY stands by these points and want to know what exactly can be done!",[removed] ,2020-11-24 18:20:23

1145,Why is CNG not more popular in India? My car runs at Rs. 2.5 per kilometer and that's cheaper than most premium bikes.,joxarc,india,125,False,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/joxarc/why_is_cng_not_more_popular_in_india_my_car_runs/,38,AskIndia,"My Hyundai xcent CNG costs between Rs. 2 and 3 per kilometer with ac in the city. This is cheaper than many bigger bikes and about 1/3 of what it costs to run on Petrol. Also, it pollutes 30% lower than cars running on conventional fuel. One can see the improvement in Delhi air from when the Sheila Dixit government implemented compulsory CNG conversion for commercial vehicles. 
Also, CNG is usually just flared in most refineries. The continuous burning flame you see from a refinery stack is natural gas, all wasted. 

My question is, instead of EVs, for which the tech is still nascent and infrastructure is a big challenge outside a few cities, why is CNG not popular across states? Very few states have developed the CNG supply chain, despite the gas being environmentally better than petrol or diesel and cheaper to supply and consume.

Some people say filling times are high. That's because the number of stations are low. Why not increase that? It doesn't take a lot of additional investment to provide CNG at a petrol pump.","car makers are not serious about cng cars, i think only maruti is making factory fitted cng. Hyundai gives i10 and xcent 

Maruti also is expensive in cng, you get lxi as top version in WagonR. 

Tata is into EV so I think they are not bothered about cng.

for car owners, it makes sense to go for cng only if you drive 1000+km per month. Also cng performance is ok in city. cng refiling can be time consuming especially when your running is high. ",2020-11-06 11:14:24

1164,"Hi, I'm a Cybersec Enthusiast. If you're a Journalist / Activist / Citizen with privacy concerns, here's a Privacy 101 for you",j4woa7,india,123,False,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/j4woa7/hi_im_a_cybersec_enthusiast_if_youre_a_journalist/,82,Science/Technology,"Hi,
I recently went through Indian news and media. I was concerned regarding the privacy violations that are happening in India as well as the recent case in UP. I express my heartily condolences to the families and prayers for them.

Getting to the topic, here's a Privacy 101 for you if you're a Journalist /	Activist / Citizen of India who doesn't want her/his private chats on live TV.



**Privacy Violations and How to Evade:**

**1. WhatsApp Chats:** Regardless of claims, WhatsApp is end-to-end encrypted and it cannot be Intercepted and decrypted without the encryption key from the user's device. The encryption key is stored in the app data folder which is only accessible to the app itself and the root user and a few other methods due to android's app sandboxing. The privacy flaw lies in the Google drive backups and the owning company Facebook. Facebook is known to violate user privacy and it's not once. The WhatsApp chat databases (msgstore) are uploaded unencrypted into Google drive. Google drive has a special feature for storing app data in a hidden folder in the drive (App Data Storage), anyone with Google credentials or a login session from Google services can access all your chat backups and read it without a key. 

**[?] How to Prevent:** Disable Google Drive Backups. The local backups are always available from Internal Storage /WhatsApp folder. The backups are encrypted so you can just copy it over to a safe location (a hardrive / pendrive / cold storage). You can also use any of the below cloud storage apps and configure automatic sync for the folder. 

**2. Call and Message Tapping:** This is usually the telecom company handing over their logs to the government on orders. Your telecom company may also monitor your internet activity by monitoring your dns queries or using DPI (Deep Packet Inspection).

**[?] How to Prevent:** Use a different number. Ask a trusted friend to get you a Sim card, and use it for account verifications and then don't keep it. You can also purchase temporary numbers online. Just change your number altogether, or use online privacy focused messaging and calling services. Do not visit HTTP websites as they'd be plain text. Use a tunneling tool like TOR with Encrypted DNS. If you dislike TOR for it's slow network, use a trusted VPN like ProtonVPN.

**3. Using a VPN make me undetectable:** NO. A VPN only tunnels your internet through their servers, preventing you from DPI and interception threats in your network (Lan, Wan, and from your ISP). Many VPN providers are known to have ""Zero Logs"" policy, but it's not known how much of it is true as their servers are private. They could hand over your internet logs to your government any time on orders, or just sell it. 

**[?] How to Prevent:** If you're into a sensitive activity I'd recommend using TOR for it. It's decentralized and no organization owns it. It routes your traffic in layers (circuits) through different self hosted servers (TOR nodes). No one on the Onion Network knows each other. (you might have just heard of it as deep web in fancy articles. It's called onion router in particular, nothing just a bunch of ip addresses. People just like fiction a lot).

**4. These apps make me a ninja online:** NO. It's you who make yourself a ninja. Keep in mind these are just tools. Your Privacy is no one's, just yours. How you handle it is your responsibility. Using real names, aliases, common passwords, typing practices, phone number, pictures, it's all you who control it. If you can make good practices, you can become a 21 century ninja.

**Using privacy focused applications and services always come with a little separation from comfort. You would have to walk that extra mile yourself for that little megabyte of data. Read u/demo_crazy's comment for more overview**

. 

**Keep in mind, using an iOS or a Mac is always great, you wouldn't require most of the apps in such case. In case you're still sus, you can find these apps for both iOS and Android.**




**Quick List:**

**1. Messaging:** Ditch WhatsApp (it's not really trustworthy). Use Signal. Its completely open-source. For more privacy use burner number. (you can also use wire and telegram).

>Instead of using burners(which surely isn't easily available in India) and then using Signal, try **Threema**. It is open source messaging app which requires no phone number to sign up.

**2. Email Client:** Use K9 Mail App, FairMail, and ProtonMail App for writing emails. K9 Mail and FairMail are email clients that support gmail and Outlook and other email providers.

> K9 Mail with OpenKeyChain is to be used to be more secure(even if you use K9 Mail with Gmail Google can scan it). Also use something like Disroot or Dismail instead of Gmail. Better to go with Protonmail or Tutanota all in all to be most secure and they have there own apps. 

**3. Email Provider:** For emails I wouldn't recommend Gmail, Outlook or Yandex. It's better to use ProtonMail and Temporary Emails. For more privacy you can use TorMail and other onion mail services.

> You can use Protonmail or Tututanota via there onion addresses instead.
>Do not use Gmail or Outlook. If it is confidential, use **Protonmail**, **Tutanota**, **Disroot** as email providers. Also, using Gmail with an open source mail app is pointless.

**4. Twitter Client App:** Talon and Twitalatte for twitter. They are open-source with no adverts.

**5. Cloud Storage:** It's not recommended to use Google Drive for things that may be sensitive. Use Tresorit and Mega Cloud for your private suff. They also have android apps and have automated folder sync.

> You can use any cloud storage (better to go for mega as said) but make sure you encrypt the content using something like cryptomator before uploading.

**6. Contacts:** Open Contacts is an awesome tool to manage your contacts that are sensitive. You can import export them as well. You can then use cloud storage apps to sync it. 


**7. Messaging:** Use Silence. It will encrypt the content of message if both parties are using Silence. But SMS is the least secure of any communication modes and it's vulnerable to all kinds of attack. QKSMS is also open-source and a good alternative if you don't need encryption. 

**8. Browser:** Firefox or Tor Browser, with duck duck go search engine and UBlock Origin, NoScripts, Https Everywhere Adblock Plus plug-ins. Ditch Chrome and UC please.

**9. Internet:** Do not use a VPN. Use Tor instead. It's decentralized, open-source and nearly untraceable. If you really need a good VPN use ProtonVPN or PIA. Use Orbot App to tunnel all your traffic through Tor. You can use Invizible app for overall private tunnel.

>Also, use a VPN for important stuff. Use **ProtonVPN**, it is free, based in Switzerland and does not keep logs. 
>Use **DuckDuckGo** or **SearX** for search engines. 

**10. Be Cautious:** These apps won't make your data private, they will help you, it's you who needs to be cautious.

>Use **Openboard**, **AnysoftKeyboard**, **Simple Keyboard** for keyboard apps. Open source and do not track your key taps.

>If you're using any of Facebook owned apps (FB, Whatsapp, Instagram) use Greenify, Hibernator to force stop them which won't allow them to run in the background.


> Ditch anything from Google. If you using Android, install a custom rom, like Lineage OS, AOSP, or Graphene without Google Apps. Use MicroG. 

Just use iOS, it's great at privacy. A de-Googled android is kind of equal if used right.

> Another suggestion which applies to journalists, Make use of securedrop for any kind of whistleblowing or sharing your jouranlism data to others. Securedrop is a really active project and it helps journalists all over the world in sharing files securely.

1166,Restaurant (1BHK Superbar) in Pune called and threatened me about my Zomato Review about their illegal service tax.,7cf8cx,india,1583,False,https://imgur.com/IrOCR0j,483,Unverified,,"Service Charge isn't illegal, Service Tax is (due to GST rollout).  
Even in US, service charge is levied by every restaurant except fast food/self serve counters as a 'tip'.  
Waiters usually get most of their wages in the form of tips (if they don't get a fair wage already, that is) in US at least, don't know about India.  
It's basically a forced tip of 10%. Thankfully they aren't charging service charge on GST+amount or vice versa, don't think that would be legal.    
In US if you leave without paying a tip, sometimes waiters will chase you down, or act rude.   
The waiters may or may not get the service charge in their pocket depending on the restaurant. However that is none of your business, and you should assume the ideal situation until the waiter complains, cause that's his problem.  
Yes, you are not forced to pay the service charge. But you also don't have any rights to complain about a rude waiter if you say ""Hey, I'm not giving you any tips"" basically.   
Your confusion of service tax/charge and the legality makes me think you don't have any idea on what is legal and what is not.

She got very agitated, but she tried convincing them saying she had provided all the details she knew about the tailor like phone number and address, and argued why they are still asking his personal details. But the citibank people were very adamant saying they will not unblock the card till she provides his date of birth.

Now it has been more than a month and repeated calls to customer care get the same answer. She threatened them with legal action, but they don't seem to care. We all are feeling helpless and agitated, but we don't know how to proceed.

Why honest, innocent and law abiding citizen has to suffer for stupidness of citibank? Think from tailor perspective, is it his mistake that his name happens to be same as a Dawood. Why citibank thinks that Dawood Ibrahim is poor enough to accept couple of hundred rupees from a stranger?",hahahaha didn't read the post; the title itself is too funny!! ,2019-05-04 17:17:05

1170,Some inside information about the 'support letter' situation in Maharashtra,e1btyt,india,0,False,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/e1btyt/some_inside_information_about_the_support_letter/,15,Unverified,"I hope everyone is well aware about the political situation in Maharashtra right now. I will post TL;dr about the situation regardless.

\- No party has the majority

\- BJP fails to maintain the government

\- Shivsena isn't able to form a goverment

\- Presidents rule is applied

\- Shivsena + NCP + Congress prepares to form the government on Saturday afternoon

\- BJP + Ajit Pawar of NCP forms the government secretly at 5AM in the morning of the Saturday.

&#x200B;

The government is allowed to be formed by the Governor because Ajit Pawar produced a letter of support with signatures of all the MLA's of NCP. Now the missing link in the story was how did Ajit Pawar was able to get this letter when NCP was about to give support to Shivsena.

The reason behind this is, NCP prepared 4 letters in total. 1 was to provide support to ShivSena. 1 was to provide support to Congress. 1 was to claim the support of other parties to form their own government and the last one was to provide support to BJP. All these letters were with Ajit Pawar as he was the leader of NCP. Fadnavis Blackmailed Ajit Pawar on Friday Midnight which forced him to give this letter to Fadnavis and allowed him to form the government. Sharad Pawar is well aware of this as just a day before he was with Mr. Modi to talk about 'Farmers'. The situation became comical as Shiv Sena wasn't aware of this 4 letters existing and thus to save face, the 'letter was forged' argument is created.

Also, AMA I guess.","You could not be more wrong. The letter that Ajit Pawar submitted in the court today with the signature of 54 MLAs is the letter making him the Legislative Party Leader. That letter makes no mention of support to BJP. If such a letter endorsing BJP as you claim exists with BJP/Ajit Pawar then the case would be over by now.

A middle class person's life is shit compared to a middle class person in a foreign country. What we would call middle class; certainly would be >20k/ month income which would put you at the top 30% of th- nah just kidding. It would put you in the top 3 fucking percent of the population which means 97% which is literally fucking everyone is poor as shit. 

If you are in a metropolitan city and made the mistake of fucking breathing, \*poof\* your lifespan went down 10 years! Festivals like bhogi in the South where you, get this, **burn plastic waste** don't help either. Then we have retards claiming havan which is burning stuff (pretty massive red flag) **reduces air pollution.** 

The roads are dirty and people who lecture others to not litter spit and litter the roads themselves. No one bats an eye and this shit goes on every single day.

&#x200B;

**Secondly : Education and business : I**f you are okay with living 10 years less, that too amongst people who believe that havan reduces pollution or are blind BJP, and pseudoscience (looking at you, Sadhguru) followers, this one will most likely change your mind if you are a student and are in general category.

Now, reservation in India you might have heard is capped at 50% but as luck would have it, my state specifically is an exception and has 79% reservation. On top of that reservation for women is being added. By the time I'm gonna finish my education reservation would be 110% which is so dumb.

You might think I should stop slacking and that if I work hard enough reservation wont matter. However, reservation gaps are really high, talk 50% in some colleges and in **extremely extreme** cases, an 94% gap. The general cutoff was 94%. No, this isn't a typo, general cutoff 94% and 94% gap does mean that the SC/ST cutoff was **0%** in a fucking PHD in mathematics in Delhi University in 2017. 

On top of that, we have shithead politicians who are striving for 100% cutoff.  This shows the government doesn't care about talent and just wants votes.

&#x200B;

**Thirdly: Taxes:** Even if I come to terms with not getting admission in college even though I scored 94% more than someone who got admission, having my lifespan cut by 10 years and political discourse being a he-said she-said shock value propoganda contest, this is the nail in the coffin.

The mean income in India as I already said is shit but even if I manage to get a good salary, where would my taxes go? In countries like Canada it would go towards free healthcare which helps people who can't afford it and in other countries, it would go toward infrastructure development in low income areas and wellfare programs. 

However, in India, the taxpayers money would be used to fund the next scandal, to buy the next member of parliament or to fuel propoganda against minority communities. I don't want to contribute a penny toward this and this is the ultimate reason I want to leave India.

I would appreciate if someone could give advice to move to a better country like the US, Australia, Canada, UK etc. Please DM me or leave a comment.","> pseudoscience (looking at you, Sadhguru) follower

Clarifying one thing right at the start, this experience happened not with me. My colleague narrated the ordeal he saw yesterday and I thought this ought to be shared.

Colleague decided to catch the movie on monday as he had the day off. Finalized the 10 AM show in Noida and he is seated along with his friend in time and the show starts. Ten minutes in, 3 lousy late comers arrive. Lousy because they couldn't keep their voices down while locating their seats. Not giggling, but laughing loudly. The group consisted of 2 males and a woman, all in their twenties. 10 more mins go by. Their chit chat is showing no signs of stopping. 

Now, a lad from the opposite side of the isle gets up and tells them nicely to keep their voices down. My colleague heard that fellow speak without any bitterness. From the group of those 3 lunatics, one of the male spoke in an irritating tone and quite loudly ""Yeah we will try not to disturb you"". That tone and wordings were signs of things to come.

These three actually started then to speak and laugh even more loudly. The male speaker from the three  now started yelling and HOOTING. The woman was not as vocal, but the two males were absolutely crass. They are clapping, laughing, yelling, and even using cuss words (chutia etc). Nobody objected to their crass behavior.

Interval arrives and the fellow who had asked em to keep their voices down goes out of the audi. He returns with a fellow from management and points out the three offensive people. What followed was even more bizzare and frustrating to even hear about.

Hooting male: ""He THREATENED us with the tone he used.""

Woman: ""We have purchased the ticket. We are three, **'baatein toh hongi'**"" (the heck?!?)

Second Male: ""He is the one disturbing us. Twice he has done that"" (?!?)

Woman: ""Look at the way he is standing in a threatening way!"" (the fellow was standing two steps back from where management rep was, and had his arms crossed + listening intently)

Hooting male: ""I am fucking being threatened and disturbed here. Why the fuck is he telling me to keep quiet? I have purchased my ticket and **I will derive my fun the way I want**. He should have purchased the entire hall's tickets if he wants us to be quiet."" (I would have punched this fellow right there and then for all this.)

I went like the actual fuck? This was being said??!!? My colleague said that he was narrating verbatim. The 3 were missing the not so subtle jokes, but were going over the top during action sequences.


There was no security guard/hall rep stationed inside while the movie was running to defend the narrative of the person who had politely asked those 3 lowly people to keep the voices down. That guy now asks the management fellow that further discussion be held outside. He leaves with the hall rep and did not return for the show. Not a single person stood up against the false narrative that was pelted. This really has irked me. I have been thinking about this incident for the past 20 minutes.

I have had my share of rowdy people at the hall, I have objected and again was not supported. But here, the way a decent fellow left the show that has felt not right. The management should have evicted those 3 and made a statement. Somebody should have supported that honest + decent fellow and should have insisted on strict action. Instead, the management was heard apologizing to that fellow, and offered him a change of seat!

1) Evicting abusive/indecent/loud people should be a thing.

2) There should be a list of banned viewers just like the airlines have a 'no-fly' list. 

3) Spine less attitude remains the bane of this country.

If any of those 3 fellows is reading this - Shame on you. To the dude who stood up, and left the show - I hope to see you objecting again one day, and I will lend you my full support there and then.

So, I'm just an another Indian engineering graduate, hailing from a village in the outskirts of Agra, looking for a new job/workplace. I'm planning to move out and starting from some place better. There are some personal reasons I'm avoiding nearby cities like Noida, NCR, etc. I did some research for possible options, and now I have my compass pointing to Kota.  


It might sound a little strange for techies to NOT opt for cities like Bengaluru, Noida, Gurugram, etc, but I can list some possible reasons for doing so. Still, if you've got something better, let me know.  


**Why Kota?**

\- Almost everyone who ended up becoming an engineer has visited Kota once in their lifetime. I've been there too, although not very long (\~2 months), but familiar to the city to some extent . 

\- I've been doing freelancing for an year now and planning to continue remote works. Kota falls in the category of cities which I expect to have better internet connections. I've looked online, looks like you guys have got Jio Fiber and Airtel Xstream services.

\- AQI is by far the selling point why I'm inclined to the city. The more I go Delhi/NCR options, the poor surrounding conditions puts me off. And now that I've options to work remotely, I'm trying to avoid polluted cities. Kota's AQI falls somewhere in the middle. It's not the best, but it ain't the worst either.

\- And most importantly, the active Covid cases count is reasonable (around 300 while writing this post). Though, there is a hell lot of controversy over rapid-antigen tests, but I still need some metric to measure the situation.

**What info have I gathered so far?**

\- PG are economical solution if someone is moving in to some unfamiliar city. It may take me around 2 to 3 months before I can have stable sources of income and gathered enough info about 1BHK apartments on rent, it seems wise to start with PG. And with the luggage from the journey, I can't wander around the city too much as well.

\- With PG, I won't have to worry about food & shelter in my initial days. Most of them, I hope, are semi-furnished (though you can correct me if I'm wrong) so I can spend some initial chilly nights without worries.

\- In terms of living, I've found some places that people on Quora recommended. Areas like Talwandi, Rajiv Nagar, etc are better places to live in.

**What do I need to know**?

\- First off, is moving to Kota good idea? I hope I'm not being paranoia.

\- Are PG still open and working during pandemic situations? Are they still letting people in?

\- How hard would it be for me to find the accommodations as an adult compared to a student?

\- If I reach Kota Junction, which places should I first look for / go to find the best deals. Don't want a big hole in the pocket. And how people are commuting? Are autos back on the road?

\- What's the status of fiber connections in the localities I've mentioned previously? Does anyone here on Reddit uses them? Are there some other localities that you'd like to recommend?

\- What's the status of electricity blackouts?

\- How much should I expect a decent PG would charge for month? I know it varies, but just for making an estimate.

\- What things should I be making clear before, you know, signing off the deal (lol) with the owner? 

&#x200B;

I think I've covered most of it, nothing else crosses my mind right now,. But if there's still something I might've completely skipped, do let me know!

My parents had left their house 1 year after their marriage due to the constant mental and verbal abuse inflicted on my mother by my mother and grandmother. And now they live in a house that is built by them and in their name . My grandmother lives with them and is financially independent and of sound mind. My 2 aunts are married. Now the issue here is my grandmother had fallen ill suddenly since the end of July. Now we have employed 2 aayahs and left the entire ground floor,along with the kitchen to them. The aayahs and all other medical equipments are paid for by my parents,my grandmother still gets a pension. 

Now my grandmother is a serial liar,and ever since she's sick she lies to everyone saying that we don't feed her enough,we  allegedly deny her medical assistance and we give her random pills forcefully. She tells my aunts these . One of my aunts live locally and they don't ever take any responsibility. They never even visit. Yet they keep telling us that she's our responsibility,and that she raised me ( total bullshit my parents had a nanny for me but she said she wanted to raise me and shoo'ed the nanny away) 

So yesterday things got a little heated when my aunt came to visit and she and my grandmother spouted lies, saying that she never got any medical care ever, that we were the ones responsible for her situation since we never gave her permission (?)  to have her haemorrhoid operation done and so on so forth. I went to call her bullshit and my aunt whipped out her phone and started recording me,and that's when my mother  told her to get out of our house. We found her again 10 mins later crouched under the window recording our conversations. Then she threatened us that she's going to call the cops on us for elder abuse. 

My uncle (aunts husband) then called and threatened my dad , saying that he's going to "" teach us a lesson""

1. First, my first twitter id (@WhiteHatSr) got suspended.
2. Then my Quora got suspended for 15 days.
3. Then my video from youtube was removed for CopyRight infringements, whereas the video was of a balloon only. This is that video: [LINK](https://twitter.com/whiteHatSnr/status/1304298709916639232).
4. Then two of my Reddit accounts got permanently suspended, one for 'Harassment'.
5. Now all the 5 videos from my video got removed from YouTube for copyright infringements. How can I comment about WhiteHatJr and Byjus without even mentioning their names?

Byjus is not just a shrewd businessman he is running an evil corporation that neither cares about the mental health of students nor about their own employers. This kind of blanket ban on speaking against one person! Is this North Korea or what?

I have been making accounts after accounts and yet nothing can be said about him. Imagine how many lakhs of voices must have been crushed by his evil corp by now. The entire quora about Byjus and WhiteHatJr is filled with manipulations and fake reviews from fake profiles, each fake profile is from IIT, IIM, AIIMS, or an expert in AI, ML, or CEO of some BS. He is selling tags for years and none of the authorities noticed it.

(Whatever I have been saying since these couple of weeks, I provided proofs for that, and for this next thing I have no proofs as of now. But I have a STRONG feeling that his claims of him being IIM 100%tile topper twice at age of 18 and 20 when he gave the exams 'just like that' is also a FAKE BS Claim.)

This Byjus guy is just like Arindam Chaudhuri, that scammer IIPM guy. Every single thing about this Byjus company is fake. Their reviews on google play store (the video of which I had posted and they got it removed), their quora reviews from fake IDs, their claims of their 'extraordinary' products, their claims that their teachers are the top 0.01% teachers, their number of students who cleared IITJEE, NEET, CAT or UPSC exams (tbh they don't even declare these numbers clearly). Every single thing is a BIG lie.

Just yesterday Byjus acquired this BS company:

I am not a finance guy, but to me, this looks like he is doing some big-time scam with the money from his VCs. Not just that his product is bad, services are rude, their advertisements are immoral but there is something way shadier about this person.

1253,The Indian military and para-military are doing something bizzare and unplanned,jis0sw,india,2218,False,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/jis0sw/the_indian_military_and_paramilitary_are_doing/,392,Politics,"I had posted previously about this topic but now there is more news. To begin with, a lot of Indians don't understand bullet calibers. To get it out of the way, bullets are not interchangeable. A bullet of 7.62 * 39 calibre cannot be fired from a rifle that shoots 7.62 * 51 and vice versa. I hope everyone understands that.



So here's the problem. The Indian military it seems will be using 3 calibers of bullets for their battle rifles. Which makes no sense at all. I can understand if the rifles have separate roles, but they will all be standard infantry rifles.


The Indian military in order to replace its ageing and useless indigenous rifles have chosen 4 rifles, seemingly without coordination. These rifles are-


1. Trichi Assault Rifle (TAR). Fires a 7.62 * 39 bullet. It's made indigenously by the Ordinance Factory Board. This seems to be nothing more than a copy of an AK-47 with minor improvements. Everything about it screams like an attempt by the OFB to stave off it's shuttering.

2. AK - 203. Fires a 7.62 * 39 bullet. This is a joint effort by Russia and India to be manufactured at Amethi. Making a new rifle is an expensive affair and this rifle is more expensive than actually just buying one from a private company. I have doubts on whether it will actually succeed. It's been delayed numerous times.


3. Sig 716. Fires a 7.62 * 51 or 7.62 NATO calibre bullet. This is made by American/German company Sig Sauer. It's a heavier calibre bullet. India ordered 180,000 + of this rifles and it has been distributed to soldiers already.


4. Caracal CAR 816. Fires a 5.56 * 45 or 5.56 NATO round. This rifle is very well made and is widely praised. A lot of Middle Eastern countries have adopted it. India ordered 80k+ of this rifle that will be delivered soon. But because of ""Make in India"" initiative,  any extra orders are scrapped. Caracal has offered to manufacture in india. It is yet to be seen what will happen.

The bullets and their differences.


1. 5.56 NATO. This is the standard infantry rifle bullet used by NATO. It's light and has a higher velocity and accuracy upto 500 yards. It's proven effective since the 60's. It's widely available and is already the standard calibre for indian military.

2. 7.62 NATO. This is a larger caliber bullet. It was the standard for Europe and even India prior to the INSAS. It's much heavier but has a longer range. It's accurate upto 1000 yards. The drawback is that because it's bigger, soldiers can carry fewer amounts of ammo. In the Falkland wars, British troops experienced ammo shortages in battle as a result. Thus they switched over to the 5.56 NATO round. Nowadays, it's used mostly as a sniper/marksman/machine gun bullet. Or for police.


3. 7.62 * 39. This is the bullet of the Soviets and Communist countries. It's been used since the 50's. It works similar to the 5.56 NATO interms of range. 500 yards. But it's heavier. So the same disadvantage of the 7.62NATO. Russia is switching over to a smaller caliber as a result. Which raises the question, why is india buying guns of this calibre? This is effectively an obsolete caliber. It's makes no sense.

India needs to modernize it's military. But there seems to be no sense or plan on how it plans to do that. The US and most of NATO and allies use the 5.56 NATO. It works. We already have stockpiles of 5.56 NATO ready. 


A team of soldiers in the field must have standard ammunition. It helps to make sure that soldiers can exchange bullets when they run out during battle. Some differences can exist, snipers and machine gunners need heavier calibers but the infantry rifleman should be armed with the same calibre of bullets. This doesn't seem to be happening. Different factions seems to be fighting within procurement department of the military.

Emphasis on *might be* because I am not a conspiracy theorist and I can't find links to the videos that have been taken down anymore (...because well, they are gone) but I tried looking into it and have a few points to make. 

I say this because the ""Pirates of Hindostan"" mash-up video I had [shared on the sub earlier](https://np.reddit.com/r/india/comments/9trh0a/i_edited_in_elements_from_the_pirates_of_the/) was taken down yesterday coinciding with the release of the film when all reviews started pouring in. Now I had isolated their vocals and used a different soundtrack so I don't use their music. Also because of the transformative nature I figured it would be covered under fair use but that is a discussion for another time. We don't have the privilege of fair use.

How this takedown was different was that it wasn't triggered by YouTube's Content ID but a [manual request by someone from YRF](https://i.imgur.com/6HFIeTj.jpg). I was warned after my upload by well-wishers that they could do something like that so I looked up other videos who were also using clips from the trailers for creating their content and thought I'd be safe. But some of them do not show in my YouTube watch history anymore suggesting that they are probably gone too. Content on bigger channels seems to be okay though. It's like they've only gone after the smaller guys. 

When I tried looking for other people who'd have had copyright claims from YRF I found out that in 2013 they didn't allow even YouTube bigwigs AIB to make a trailer parody. They did a video response about it too- https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-H3BIJ2BFE. 
Same production house, same director and same lead actor 5 years later and same story with most parody content. 

I understand they're well within their rights to do so and YouTube allows them to protect their IP in different ways. It's just a little shady and I just wanted to rant because I was upset my video was down. Thanks for reading. 
",Is it only parodies or reviews too? They can pull this shit on parodies but genuine reviews that might not be legal. Even parodies itself should be fine if they are not using any clips from the film. ,2018-11-09 23:29:55

Today I walked in a little early at around 6 PM. When I entered the gym, the first thing I heard was an older lady telling me to get out. I replied excuse me, as I was genuinely confused. To which she pointed at the door and said get out in a louder harsher tone. This really irked me and I confronted her and asked her to talk politely to which she said gym has ladies time from 4 PM to 7 PM. I told her there is no such rule written anywhere and asked her to show me proof. To this, she replied to go talk to the manager. I told her since it's her claim, she should show me proof to which she said don't argue, just get out. I told her even I can bring a couple of guys in the gym and tell you, people, that this is gents hour if I don't have proof, to which she shouted even more loudly saying don't talk back and asked me to get out. I just scoffed and proceeded to walk to my workout station where she physically stopped me and said something like such mannerless youth come here nowadays. I replied saying, I am just asking a question, which I have the right to and proceeded to my workout station by walking around her.

I think this hurt her ego, and she went and called the manager. When the manager came, she told him I was rude to her and was harassing her physically (her claim was I pushed her and went) and her aunty squad was backing her up. In fact, this woman had grabbed my hand and tried to physically stop me from entering and now was accusing me of me abusing her verbally and pushing her. This is when I really wanted to whack her, but knowing how the law works it would have gone to her favor. Luckily, some other women in the gym stood up for me and said I didn't do anything but ask her for proof of the rule to which the aunty replied something akin to us accusing her of lying (which she was). When she knew she wasn't going to win this, she started demanding an apology from me, which I obviously refused. This is when she abused me some more and said something on the lines of aaj kal ke ye bacche and left while threatening me she will handle me later. I think that's when the manager realized the lady was full of shit. He then calmly explained to me about the new gym timing rules. I told him, if she would have politely asked me to leave and shown me the new rule, I would have left. I just confronted her because she was extremely rude to me for no reason. 

Dunno where this entitlement comes from in these old fucks. Just because they are old, they think they can get away with anything.

**Tl;dr: I was accused of verbal and physical abuse by some old aunty because I asked her a question and got saved by some women in my gym.**



**Edit: Manager took the blame in the end and apologized for that, to which I said that's fine. This rule was instated some 3 days ago and was apparently sent to everyone in the building Whatsapp group (which I am not a part of since my brother owns the flat). So the lady had a physical copy of the rule on her. But she didn't want to show it to me because elders should be listened to without any questions. I told the manager to please post it on the door or something so something like this doesn't happen again. I also told him, the only reason I got irked was that the lady was being really rude and downright abusive.**","I honestly think you need to go apologize and thank the manager.
He didn't do his job, it's his mistake.. yes I agree.

Hear me out. When Covid started, the Indian govt had the worst lockdown in the whole world. I remember it was in the top 5 on the Stringency index in the world. What happened was a lot of people died because of the incompetency of the government. Do you remember the videos of people walking on foot? Or the videos where they had to walk on the railway tracks because of the police? Or the news when so many of them were killed by the train? A ton of them had to borrow money later to take the train to return to their villages. Other countries also had lockdowns too, but they didn't abandon their citizens to die.

While other socialist countries paid their citizen 60% of the salary or something like that, the Indian govt launched ~~atmanirbhar~~ **bhagwan bharose** scheme. It basically means fuck you. You are on your own now. All the TV channels are promoting it like retard instead of demanding actually support from the govt. It's a pandemic and we are a socialist nation. What are we paying taxes for, if we can't expect support from govt during a pandemic?

One time, they refuse landing permission to a flight full of stranded Indian when it arrived at Indian airport? Tell me which other sane countries do such shit. Now they also have restrictions on domestic air travel just to extort money. You need to pay for govt quarantine when you travel by domestic flight, but you can spread covid as much as you want if you travel by road. Does it make any sense?

Now, they are behaving as if covid is over. It's not. Govt is behaving like this since August. Earlier when we had 100 covid cases, we converted trains to quarantine rooms. But when we have millions, we are behaving as if doesn't exist. Hospital full. Data intentionally absent. In my hometown, they banned covid testing. I know because I had to apply for the test for travel reasons but all the labs told me that CMO has banned COVID testing. If you die of covid, the report will say anything but covid.

While Europe is in the second lockdown, Indian is relaxed like we are the most developed country in the world with the best infrastructure and hospitals. If European countries are out of hospital beds and ICU, how come we have a ton of free beds? Rules are jokes either. No masks, fully crowded markets 7 days a week. Gatherings? My cousin is celebrating the 5th birthday of his kid and inviting 150-200 peoples. Can you believe? Everything is allowed.

India is doomed.","Govt is not God that they can do everything right first time ...  this is something for which no one was prepared .. i think we handled it gracefully, except the immigrant part which should have been taken care jointly with states/central gracefully ..

Anyway this is about my interaction with the UP Police (Ghaziabad). This incident was so traumatising for me that it still fills me with anxiety whenever I think about it. 

I (17 M at that time) was hanging out with my 3 (let's call them A,B,C) friends in this park eating noodles. There was some sort of check point near the park so a lot of police were gathered around the area. We didn't mind much and were minding our own business. So friend A and B went to get some snacks from the nearby shop. I and C were sitting there and started taking some pictures when this policeman called me. He was staring at us for a while. 

I went upto him and he started questioning me like where I am from and what work does my father do. I was dumbfounded and scared so I started telling him everything. Soon 3 policeman joined him as well. They all started questioning me. C was panicking but she was far away so she couldn't hear what was going on. 

I tried to remain as calm as possible and replied them whatever they asked. They started asking me ""Is randi ko kitne me liya"" , "" taange tod denge teri sach bta"" , "" Ek raat dede iske saath"". I was practically on the verge of crying and begging them to let me go. And like the sadistic fucks they were they started pushing me and telling me "" Chal thane me tujhe batate hain"".  But soon they left me alone. 

I went back to C. I couldn't tell her anything since she was pale as a ghost. I just calmed her down and we searched for our other friends. I don't know why but we kept this a secret from them.

I am JU chemical engg dropout, pursuing a cse degree from a 3 tier college at the age of 25. Recently, one of my seniors from JU(2014 batch), whom I have never spoken to in my entire life approached me for a ""business proposal"". When I asked him what the business was about, he said it's an ecommerce business. I asked him if it's something like shopify. He said no and he said the details can only be explained to me in person. It sounded like a mlm/pyramid scheme/ponzi scheme to me. I have experiences of this from 2012, when I was 18, a school friend of mine was doing a similar thing. But I was smart back then and I am smart now, so I decided to play along. He invited me over to Starbucks, Park Street, yesterday. Now, I have experiences of freelancing and side hustles. So, when I met him I was giving him advice how business is not a short time thing but its a long journey and it's totally based on luck. We were supposed to meet his ""mentor"". Another friend of his, who did his BTech in mechanical and did his MBA from IIM A, was there, he was giving me advice, how to get rich in 3-4 years. I don't believe in quick money and even if you earn that sort of money in 3-4 years, your lifestyle will change according to this new found wealth and that money won't last long. This is what I was telling them. Now, mind it, these guys are  3-4 years elder to me. And I was giving them advice. I didn't even know that this guy was from IIM A. When he said that, I was shocked. I was like, I can't believe Im giving advice to people whose qualifications I can never match. Anyway, this IIM A guy leaves after 20 minutes and the mentor comes around 5 pm. He sees my marketing skills and my talent. But then he tells me about "" Rich dad poor dad"" And shows how with their MLM scheme I can earn 3-4 crores in 3-5 years. Now this mentor, is a MBA graduate from XLRI, and was a banker and what not. I couldn't believe, graduates from such premier instutions were doing this. I only have to invest 3 lacs upfront and then hire 10 people and mentor them to hire 10 more and this keeps going on. So, what's the endgame here? Either someone will run off with this money, or they have to perpetually add new members to their MLM to sustain the cashflow and marketing. They asked me if I would like to have something at Starbucks. I refused because I am an unemployed student, and I know then I would have to pay the bills. Those people spend their time in starbucks yet drink normal tap water and nothing else from there. Who are they fooling with their ""looking rich"" Lifestyle?? One thing that I have learned from the 2008 recession was most investment bankers and bankers in general are Grade A crooks. White collar criminals. I can't believe that IIM A guy spent 30 lacs on his degree to do this now. They are now harassing me over whatsapp to send me 3 lac rupees within wednesday.

 If students and alumnus from premier institutions are doing this, I wonder what the rest of the country is upto. That ""mentor"" simply asked me to switch off my brain for the next 3-5 years and do as he says, then I will become rich. They were showing me videos of events they had in Bangkok last year and they are going to conduct another one next week. I have been to Bangkok with my own hard earned money at the age of 22, so such things don't attract me. I could hardly control my laughter. I would have laughed off on their face. But I was smart, I nodded and I agreed and then ran the f*** out of that place as soon as possible. I believe talking to them is a simple waste of my time, energy and mental resources. I can't believe these people have quit their jobs and doing this fulltime for a living. I want to make people aware of such scams. Please do NOT fall into such money making traps. There is no quick money or success in life. Also, please have the integrity and character to never scam anyone in your life, no matter how hard the times get. Even if you have to beg on the streets, but don't scam others.

Any advices or suggestions are always welcome. 
TLDR : graduates from IIM A, JU-IIT Roorkee, XLRI running a huge ponzi scheme/MLM/pyramid scheme",Bro I am from one of those mentioned colleges and I never saw anyone indulging in MLM schemes.

AAP MP from Delhi Sanjay Singh says that the amount set aside for homoeopathy in the AYUSH ministry **budget is very small.** 

""Some say that there is no scientific proof for homoeopathic medicines effectiveness. **Homoeopathy is a strain of medicine that focusses not just on the disease but also the patient.** **The science behind this is not visible to us**,"" he says.

""For instance, two ways of combating COVID-19 are by vaccine and by boosting immunity. **Methods to boost immunity are available only in Indian medicine, and not by Western medicine**,"" he says. It is regrettable that we did not explore Indian medicine in depth earlier, says Dr. Trivedi. He adds that the **only way to become a world leader is by being a pioneer, and not a follower.** He cites the time and money China has poured into exploration of their traditional medicine as an example.

I would appreciate if someone experienced could share his/her views as a Developer working in India and how could you land at a job. Is it possible to get a remote job? Do I need to get a degree? And also maybe some technical stuff like what languages are in demand and what's the starting salary that a full stack developer gets in india?","> How did I land a job?

First gig I applied, second gig onwards, it was just a lot of schmoozing I guess.

I have interviewed only five times so far and I was able to land a gig four of the five times. I am pretty good at schmoozing and also at my work.


> Is it possible to get a remote job?

Yes, but. 
1. How many years of work experience do you have?

2. How many years of _quality_ work experience do you have?

3. Can you actually write a program?

> Do I need to get a degree?
Yes. Plain and simple reason - all things considered,  it is an indicator of your ability to persist through something. If you're a dropout for reasons that cannot be really justified, it gives me a bad indicator as a recruiter about your ability to persist.

> What languages are in demand

Whatever languages which get the job done. Not that the Tiobe Index is bad, but C programming gigs in India are few and far in between.

Golang is pretty hot right now, but I personally don't touch it with a ten-foot pole because I think it's inability to have a decent error handling mechanism makes it a dumpster fire. I don't know what Rob Pike was on when he decided to drop error handling from the language's design.

Python is pretty nice - gets me from A to B without getting in my way. But PEP517 packages just increase my build times to absurdly high amounts.


> Full stack dev starting salaries

I guess Bangalore could be as low as 500K and as high as 3Mil depending on the place you're working at, which, may or may not be a function of the college you graduate from.

Noida, Bombay, Delhi - stay away from these places. Pretty shoddy tech culture.

Chennai - if you're a northerner who struggles even with English, then stay away. Actually, if you're a northerner and are planning on coming down here of your own volition, I would say please rethink. As much as we have the freedom of being able to move here and there and settling wherever, it makes no sense for you to come down to a place where you would struggle to speak the local language.

Such allegations are totally baseless and will only hurt BJP in the long run. Except for Punjab, protests have started erupting in other states like Haryana, U.P, Karnataka, etc. as well. For 1-2 videos of Khalistani fringe elements in the movement, there are countless other videos of farmers serving langar to police, leaders, asking the crowd to remain peaceful even if violence erupts.

BJP just doesn't understand Sikhs and Punjabi's, they have been trying really hard to prove that Sikhs are Hindus even when there are major ideological differences between the two. Also, this is the same community which constitutes 8-10% of the Indian army despite only being 2% of the population. Asking them to prove loyalty every now and then will backfire in a huge way.

For all those downvoting, just don't downvote because you are against Neem, Read the evidence present here and decide for yourself.Help me popularize this dry lab study as this might prevent millions from getting affected by COVID-19 if neem can be taken as preventive medicine.

P.S : I am Shanmuga Subramanian the guy who found Vikram lander debris on Moon and this is not a medical advice.This is just a suggestion for our scientists to look Neem as preventive medicine as Neem exhibits high inhibition against COVID-19 in DryLab study

Neem has been subject of 3000+ research papers in Medical [field.It](https://field.It)'s well known for it's anti-viral properties and researchers has published it's effectiveness against HIV,Herpes, SmallPox,ChickenPox etc., So this got me interested to see how Neem fares against COVID-19.

**Molecular Docking & Drug Screening:** Molecular Docking is a method using Software by which we can analyze one compounds binding affinity with another compound to see whether they can form a stable complex.Higher the negative binding energy, more stable complex is formed.

In Biology terms small molecules(drugs) called ligands are docked with Enzyemes (Virus Proteins) to see how they dock effectively and docking leads to inhibition of the Enzyeme. By this method they do virutal screening of drugs to see which drugs can be effective and then they do in-vitro (lab tests) and in-vivo tests (clinical tests)

\*\*Neem against COVID-19:\*\*I took some 80+ compounds present in Neem leaves did molecular docking study with COVID-19 Main Protease and found that

* Some compounds exhibit higher binding affinity than drugs like Remdesivir and HydroxyChloroquine
* One molecule in Neem exhibited -14.3 kcal/mol (Remdesivir's was -13.1)
* Nearly 20+ compounds in Neem exhibit greater binding affinity than HydroxyChloroquine

Scientists:  What I need from Scientists is to do in-lab tests by using aqueous extract of  Neem leaves against COVID-19 and then go for Clinical trials (Since I dont have access to any labs, I can do any tests on these)I strongly believe Neem leaves taken at the onset of COVID-19 can acts as preventive medicine and inhibit the virus as it stops any virus from spreading to unaffected cells (You can contact me on Twitter  ID : Ramanean if you need more details on this)

1375,Using Python to Expose White Hat Jr: Fake/Duplicate Reviews on Play Store,k8edvw,india,1127,False,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/k8edvw/using_python_to_expose_white_hat_jr_fakeduplicate/,50,Business/Finance,"**TL;DR**: 3.73% of White Hat Jr reviews are fake/duplicates and a lot more are very suspicious. Code attached at the bottom.

&#x200B;

I was browsing White Hat Jr reviews a couple of hours ago and noticed an awful lot of them seemed to repeat over and over again. To confirm my suspicion and as I had also seen a few screenshots from [u/pooniahigh](https://www.reddit.com/user/pooniahigh) with the exact same text in two consecutive reviews, I decided I would write a simple program that checks for duplicate reviews.

So I wrote it and tested it for the WhiteHatJr app (com.whitehatjr) as well as the GitHub app (com.github.android) and the output gives me two conclusions-

&#x200B;

*(Statistics only account for reviews in english)*

&#x200B;

**WhiteHat Jr (com.whitehatjr)**

&#x200B;

36.96% (2081/5630) of 5 star reviews are exact matches

&#x200B;

3.73% (210/5630) of long 5 star reviews (3+ words) are exact matches

&#x200B;

**GitHub (com.github.android)**

&#x200B;

13.42% (89/663) of 5 star reviews are exact matches

&#x200B;

0.0% (0/663) of long 5 star reviews (3+ words) are exact matches

&#x200B;

* AT LEAST \~4% of the longer reviews for WhiteHatJr are fake/duplicates. (I say at least as this program doesn't use any string similarity algorithms, it checks for the exact same text so even if 1 character was different it hasn't been counted).

&#x200B;

* WhiteHatJr has a LOT (\~3 times) more 1-2 word reviews like 'nice app' or 'good' than the other example. These may be fake as well, but the evidence is inconclusive.

&#x200B;

Code:

    # pip install google-play-scraper
    from google_play_scraper import Sort, reviews_all
    import json
    
    review_list = reviews_all(
        'com.whitehatjr',
        sleep_milliseconds=50,
        sort=Sort.NEWEST,
        filter_score_with=5
    )
    
    review_list_json = json.loads(json.dumps(review_list, default=str))
    review_content, frequency_dict = [], {}
    duplicate_total, duplicate_sentence_total = 0, 0
    
    for i in range(len(review_list_json)):
        review_content.append(review_list_json[i]['content'].casefold())
    
    for i in review_content:
        frequency_dict.update({i: review_content.count(i)})
    
    for k, v in frequency_dict.items():
        if v > 1:
            duplicate_total += v
            try:
                if k.count(' ') > 2:
                    duplicate_sentence_total += v
            except:
                pass
    
    print(f'{str((duplicate_total / len(review_list)) * 100)[0:5]}% ({duplicate_total}/{len(review_content)}) of 5 star reviews are exact matches')
    print(f'{str((duplicate_sentence_total / len(review_list)) * 100)[0:4]}% ({duplicate_sentence_total}/{len(review_content)}) of long 5 star reviews (3+ words) are exact matches')

Note: I am by no means an expert on this so feel free to correct me if some/all of the information was incorrect.

Edit 1: As suggested by [u/bhiliyam](https://www.reddit.com/user/bhiliyam/), here is a 3rd stat (duplicate long review/total long review) in addition to (duplicate review/total review) and (duplicate long review/total review) ->

&#x200B;

**WhiteHat Jr**

7.01% (215/3064) of long 5 star reviews (3+ words) are exact matches

&#x200B;

**GitHub**

0.0% (0/464) of long 5 star reviews (3+ words) are exact matches","Not defending WhiteHatJr  - but this test gives misleading results, which shouldn't be taken at face value. 

The sample size for WhiteHat reviews is 5630, which is around 9 times more than the sample size for GitHub which is 663. This makes it more likely for the WhiteHat reviews to have duplicates, just by the laws of statistics. Just like in a school register with 1000 names, you will likely find more students who share the same first name than in a class register with only 100 names. 

Assuming a standard probability of 0.0005 that two given short 5-star reviews are identical: 

Average number of duplicates for GitHub(683 samples) = 96 or 14.05 %

Average number of duplicates for WhiteHat (5630 samples) = 1545 or 27.4 %

This shows that you would expect more duplicates reviews in the WhiteHat review sample, even if there was no tampering of reviews involved - simply because there were more reviews tested for WhiteHat than GitHub. 

Of course, the data showing 36% of identical reviews for the WhiteHat app is still much higher than the expected 27.4 %. So maybe there is something more to investigate there. 

None of this is meant to discourage OP in any way - keep up the good work! The data is useful, we just need to be careful with how we interpret it. ",2020-12-07 18:43:38

Please help,irrovp,india,2468,False,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/irrovp/byjus_and_whitehatjr_are_harassing_me_please_help/,300,Science/Technology,"I posted a video on youtube and Byjus stooges got it removed for copyright infringement. They got my quora also banned for speaking against them. Please see the video and see if I violated any copyright infringements.  This text below is the appeal I have done to Youtube for removing the ban on me.

*""*  

*The removal of the video was not just a mistake, it was in fact an intentional and direct attack on my freedom of speech.*

*1. The content in the video was original and I recorded it from my phone.  The background audio was the natural audio, it wasn't any music or something like that.*

*2. Aiplex software works on behalf of Byjus and they are trying to suppress all opinions raised against Byju's company. On Quora also they are banning everyone who has raised any voice against them. This is totally wrong and it is against my freedom of speech. I have full right to express my review of Byju's company. They target 6-year-old kids with their false advertisements and I can't even speak against it?*

*3. The video was COMPLETELY mine and Aiplex has no right to remove it. They did it so that now they can get my personal information to harass me. But let's make it clear that I wont be suppressed. I will move to the courts and go all the way to get my freedom to express my opinion.* 

*4. Byjus is looting people and forcing them to take loans. In fact, Byju's and WhiteHat Jr themselves are violating copyright infringements of Google, Elon Musk, BlueOrigin, Barak Obama, Bill Gates, and the list goes on. They are using their names illegally in their youtube ads. How come you YouTube guys didn't see any wrong in that? How is that allowed and you are banning my channel for expressing my opinion about them?* 

*WhiteHatJr has been selling false pipe dreams of 150 crore INR salary to 6-year-old kids, and I can't express my opinion about that?*

*Reviews of WhiteHatJr on Google Play store are all Fake, copy paste, and repeat. Hey Google, how is that allowed and you are banning me? Under IPC section 416, fake reviews are illegal in India. Still, google play store isn't looking into it and banning my account for speaking this out loud!*

*WhiteHatJr is using Barak Obama's video which he made for non-profit organization* [*code.org*](https://code.org) *.*

*This is the original video:*

*Hey Google, how can anyone use Barak Obama’s video in their ads and I can't even post a video of a balloon?*

*WhiteHatJr seems not to care about copyright infringements and has gone completely shameless in selling their course which is already freely available on the internet.*

*Youtube people please look into this closely and please dont let them harass me like this again because in the future also I will keep posting about their false advertisements and fake reviews.*

*I will also be posting this entire ‘Counter Notification’ on social media to make it public.*

I'd be especially interested in what it's like in India, because of the celebrity status many of your players seem to achieve. I'm from New Zealand, and I would guess that outside of Williamson, Taylor and Southee, maybe 20% of New Zealanders could name another player.

&#x200B;

**On the Kohli/Gavaskar/Sharma situation.**

From what I understand, from the follow ups on this story, Gavaskar's comment (which apparently was interpreted incorrectly by some twitter trolls) was just a statement of fact; not an offensive jab. To summarise, all that was said, was; 'During lockdown Kohli was only able to practice against the bowling of family members / non-cricketers'.

I think you really need a vivid imagination to think that is somehow offensive. Even if the comment came from a partially 'sexist place', I'm not sure there is evidence to reflect that, at all.

If he'd said something along the lines of 'Kohli was only able to practice against women during lockdown', then that's a different story.

Are similar stories told by the cricketing media of your home? And please tell me if I'm uninformed here; I don't know your culture well and am going by what other people have said online about this.

Even if we are scoring well on the official stats, there are more than enough reasons to suspect worse things are happening behind the cover. I think these are some of the laws/things we definitely need to update to solve at least some of the problems.

Laws we need to add:

**Marital rape should be recognized:** Marriage does not mean infinite consent.

**Rape of males should be recognized:** Rapes involving a male victim is more common than you think. Also, these are a lot more underreported than rapes involving a female victim.

Also, we need to get rid of these laws:

**Age of consent should be reduced to 16:** The age of consent currently is 18 which is unreasonably high. We need to lower this or have some sort of ""[Romeo and Juliet](https://marshalldefense.com/blog/romeo-and-juliet-laws-and-the-sexual-activity-of-minors/)"" clause to ensure sexual activity between consenting minors isn't being automatically criminalized for no reason.

**We need to get rid of the "" pretext of false promise to marry"" law:** This law hurts more people than it protects and is almost impossible to get a conviction out of. Not to mention it makes little sense.

**Criminalization of consensual sexual activity by parents needs to stop:** A surprisingly large percentage of reported rape cases were filed by parents who disagreed with their daughter’s consensual sexual activity. This is a result of our society's premarital sex taboo and has no clear solution. One solution would be to make it so that the victim's statement should always be allowed to override the parent’s statement.

In 2013, about 60% of rape cases in Delhi fell under one of these laws ([source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rape_in_India#/media/File:Verdicts_in_Delhi_Rape_Cases,_2013.jpg)). These obscure laws flood our courts with unnecessary cases leaving less room for rape cases that deserve more attention. Not to mention the unnecessary suffering these cause.

These law changes should also make it harder for someone to frame someone in a false rape case which would restore many people’s trust in our justice system and make it easier to convict on the victim’s statement in absence of other evidence.",I’d agree with all your changes except for the marital rape one.

The kind of environment we have in India, we rarely get to interact with the opposite sex. Even more, in smaller places. 
So, people fuck at the opportunity they get, it's normal. 
Except, our legal system is broken. The law itself, on paper isn't bad. But the police, and legal system are notorious for being able to manipulate as well as get manipulated. Which means if you family is influential or rich enough, you can get away with crap. 
For being influential, don't imagine that you need to be Salman Khan level rich. Your mama being local police in some gaon, is influence enough. Your chacha being a criminal  lawyer in the gaon and hanging out with the local police, is influence enough. 

I'm a lawyer, who has seen enough cases where men are behind bars for sleeping with their girlfriend, who turned out to be a minor (17 years). That's statutory rape. 

Before you get into a misogynistic rant, wait. 

It's not about the women either. It's not men versus women. 

Very few cases are filed by those 17 year olds. In fact most tragidies look something like this - 
Boy friend and girl friend fuck. Very often, with little age gap between them. Except the guy has crossed 18 and the girl, hasn't. 

She gets pregnant and decides to get an abortion done without anyone's knowledge. 
She goes to a doctor, except the doctor is obliged by law, to report it to the police as a case of rape if the girl is under 18. If the doctor doesn't, he/she is also committing an offence. 

Those young girls, who just wanted an abortion, now find themselves in the middle of a criminal case, they never intended to file. 

Second case scenario, the couple gets caught. And in India, for the parents - claiming your daughter got raped, is more respectful than admitting that she fucked her boyfriend and enjoyed it (shit 18 years olds around the world do). 

So this is a very complex situation where too many pathetic ideas of Indian society fuck people's lives - it's not men v/s women. 

Also, Indian governments (doesn't matter which one) has a history of trying to ""fix"" the crimes against women by nonsensical freebies like stricter laws. They don't always help. Just gets them temporary brownie points. 

Law isn't going to fix much if it is enforced by the same sexist system, dominated by people with same sexist ideas. 

Real life example - 

I've been asked this directly by a judge, if my client (21 year old) will marry the girl (17 year old) during a rape case. Now in this case, it wasn't a real rape. The guy had so many pictures of them taking holidays together in nearby gaon and lakes. They were having an affair. The girl loved him and even in her own cross examination, admitted to most things no rape victim would admit. I was equally sorry for that girl who was being pressured by her family to do all this. 

However, if it was a real rape. Just imagine. An almost 60 year old judge's solution here is - will the guy marry the girl? 

So, please don't fuck crazy. Don't fuck a woman you can't trust. Don't fuck someone who's family you don't trust. Don't fuck a woman who is 'not' (edited and added) an enthusiastic participant. 
And don't ever fuck a minor.

Edit 1 - oh God. It's a typo. Don't fuck a woman who is NOT an enthusiastic participant.

Edit 2 - 'don't fuck crazy' is a very common urban phrase. Not misogynistic, I'm a woman. I've seen mysogyny first hand having lived in India. I also don't blame women, because I see this as a very nuanced problem than men versus women . 

The point of this post being, don't sleep with crazy people. Of course minors was mainly what my post was about. But it's obviously wider than that. 
Don't fuck women with crazy families. Don't fuck women you can't trust to not fuck with your life. 
Also, before jumping down my throat (those of you, who are doing that), remember as women we always have our system on alert mode. We are careful usually not to sleep with guys who are likely to rape us, etc. Society beats that shit into us, because if raped, we know we will get blamed. 
I'm just telling men to exercise some caution while choosing a woman to sleep with. Get your system a little alert too. You are running some risk here too.","So you're admitting that many rape cases are just fake?

I didn't want to vote today, but something inside told to be a responsible citizen and do my fucking basic civic duty. So I went to the booth excited, and when I presented my voter ID and the voting list member paper, I saw that my name had already been struck off. I felt enraged and almost lashed out at the people there. They started arguing amongst themselves and told me to check the numbers/ward etc once again. They told me I was the 489th person to vote and one senior person took my sign for cross referencing with his book of signs. Apparently this stranger used his adhaar card and voted. I was like ""how the hell, I just brought you my slip of my name in the polling list"". 
 I felt some of them knew about this shit and were just playing along. 

I just left with disappointment, I was already tired and didn't need this, but more importantly I felt like my identity was stolen. So that random stranger who voted on my behalf, fuck you and the party you voted for.

I'm a 19 yo queer looking for answers, my main question is in the title and the rest is kind of a TIL and a thought-provoking speech and additional questions, and this post is mainly focused on Hinduism because I was born in a Hindu conservative family and again, I am looking for answers.

So, **TIL** United Kingdom has legalized same-sex marriage back in *2013.*

In India, where Homosexuality was never looked down upon, just happened to decriminalized section 377, only 2 years ago and we are still fighting for legal marriage recognition for same-sex couples.

People who have actually made it a crime have realized their mistake and moved on so far and we who have been indifferent all throughout history still this far back.  
How did this come to happen? How are you okay with it?

Hinduism is the oldest religion with it's Vedas dating back to 6000 BC, AND not even one Veda saying homosexuality is a sin, and with 75% of the population of India being Hindus I'd assume there'd be more supporters or at least people who are indifferent than haters, or non-supporters, India is slowing changing I'm not saying it's not but the thing is in real life, lgbtq+ children are more prone to abuse and harassment by family, friends, and discrimination by society. Even if there are people who are indifferent towards lgbtq+ people they don't want anyone from their family to be queer.

I can't seem to wrap my head around how come Hindus are letting this happen even in **TODAY's** society and even in the Hindu communities.  


Below are just additional questions to think about?

Are you people trapped at a time when we were being ruled?

Are parents who abuse their child for being queer, whose excuse is that it's for their own good actually looking out for their children or themselves? 

Why is it that the acceptance is so very low and children are so afraid of being thrown out?

Why is it that children aren't being able to be themselves with their own parents? 

Why is it that parents who should be loving their children unconditionally abusing their children for staying up late or for getting a B grade?

Why is that an assigned male at birth child's mental health is totally disregarded and is a joke? 

Why should I be the one ashamed to talk about sexual abuse on me?

Why is there a negative stigma around people with mental health issues? 

Why aren't more people focused on preserving the world and looking out for future generations, as many as who wanted Hyderabad to be renamed Bhagyanagar?","There is hardly any awareness, yet.

Is there widespread awareness of racism in India ? You can still open a newspaper with 'fair brides wanted'. So how do you think there will be widespread acknowledgement of LGBTQIA as something not 'sick/ abnormal/ to be rebuked/ pitied.

Good news - the younger generations are becoming more and more aware, wait may be it will happen organically.

Sexuality, gender are hushed topics. I was sexually abused as a child when I confided to my guardians they rebuked me and shut me up. When I talked about it to friends, they said they are clever and brave so they know how to stop abuse.. basically I was victim blamed. We aren't still there. Conformism is still the gospel.

I think we shouldn't give up, push it, keep talking and shouting about it till changes start to show, there will be smirks and dismissals but some day it will start to get serious.

He shivers all over, quits eating (this sucks to see cause food is his biggest joy in life), sticks as close to me as is possible and all his curiosity for life flies out of the window. The life in him that I love so much is dampened.

Today morning, a cracker went off while my dog was sitting next to my Dad pestering him for a bite of his breakfast (my dog's morning routine). Within seconds, he came running to me, tail between his legs, ears flattened, searching for a place to hide. I tried to cajole him to bring him back to his usual self - bite of Dad's breakfast, strolling outside, no luck so far. Yeah. He paws at me if I sit at my studying table in such moments, cuz I think it creates a physical distance between us. As I write this, he is right next to me with as much bodily contact as possible.

There is no Diwali for me or for my other friends who have dogs/cats (or other species of pets, I guess). Hell, within a couple of days when people are finally done with bursting crackers, I am gonna cook my doggo some chicken, light a lamp and gonna take a walk.

I am the primary tenant of a Nestaway property, I have been living there for past 10 months.The entire flat was on my name as I transferred Rs. 1,28,000 from Nestaway app. Also I got two people on board to share the flat with me & got them added as co-tenants in the rent agreement. I recently decided to shift.

As a result of which Nestaway said that if I move out then the other co-tenants will have to move out as well, because the agreement is on my name. After a month of discussion Nestaway finally came to a conclusion that if the co-tenants want to stay in that property they will have pay me my share of security deposit and then I can put up an email saying that Nestaway doesn’t owe me anything and my account can be transferred to one of the other co-tenants.

Instead of doing this, the area manager Prem with two of my other co-tenants(Mellisa & Shruti) conspired against me and deleted & cleared all the records from Nestaway app, including deposit & monthly transactional details from my Nestaway account through backend and might have probably divided my security deposit among themselves.

I found out that my account was actually handed over to Mellisa without my permission. And on Nestaway records it now says that she is the one who has been staying there for past 10 months.

I have tried reaching out to Nestaway for help but they have refused to reinstate my account as the area manager Mr.Prem seem to be in cahoots with the property manager.

I wish I knew about their reviews beforehand. I have come into contact with various other people using services of Nestaway, and after hearing about their rampant fraudulent practices from customers across the country , I am really concerned that I am going to lose my hard earned money. 

I have had bad experiences with other companies as well but this is something unprecedented for me that my app data including all the transaction listings, my KYC , my bank account details and other profile details were removed from my account with the help of backend team as if I never used Nestaway in my life. 

I just wish this message reaches a wider audience, as I believe companies like Nestaway should know that they cannot harass their tenants after taking hard earned money from them & continue to thrive. 

I have various proofs including transaction details, mails, call recordings etc to support claims made by me.",Prem. Are you in ghaziabad? That guy is an asshole. ,2019-11-20 20:53:08

Well, i have pledged never to smoke or do drugs but Alcohol was in my ""to-do"" list. At least i wanted to try. 

I started with Beer and i suppose it was a mistake. It was fucking horrible. The taste wanted me to throw up anytime and i don't know what happened, i jumped from Beer to Scotch, Whisky and Rum. All were horrible in taste and i cannot perceive why people like them so much. Only difference was the degree of shittiness. 

Nevertheless, i got to experience what really happens when your Body meets alcohol. I felt lightheaded but nothing sort of the television drunk illustration. Anyway, i woke up to a slight headache. 

Review- Party was worth it and at least i completed on of the tasks in my to-do list but Alcohol isn't some sort of magical drink which you would fall in love with it. Beer is fucking pathetic.

Agriculture needs an LPG like reforms of 1992

As our economy gets more liberalised, our farms are still stuck in pre-1992, socialist license raj era, and agricultural markets have failed to modernise. Liberalisation was heavily opposed in 1992, but we now realise what a landmark that was!

Our farms need this, our farms need Liberalisation more than ever. For the romance of Socialism and Socialist policies, it has only lead to farmer suicides and nothing more.

The less money the famer has, it benefits the money lender, who mostly tends to be a political figure.

The less access the famer has to markets, and only has one mandi to sell produce in, it helps the Mandi Board, who's president is also a politician.

And those in Lutyens, who know nothing about farming, want an issue to criticise the government.

For long farmer has been in speeches, but farmer's plight has only helped the politician.

An infrastructure for Contract farming only helps the farmer, who will need tools like MSP far less frequently. Free markets bring in better prices for the consumers.

And once, private mandis come in, corporates come in, they come in with the investment needed for transportation, for storage, and the farmer finally has the choice to sell, to sell wherever they want, to whom they want, for the price they want.

Not everything corporate or liberalised is bad, liberalisation comes with its perks, and the perks here are to push away farm imports, push away price controls and finally make our famers lives better, and atmanirbhar!

Free markets have worked, best example for that would be Bihar (don't let anyone lie 2006 removal of APMC Act made Bihar's farmer's worst off)

Bihar's production growth rate has been double that of India's Average for last 15 years in post APMC era!

2) Mental illnesses get inherited. This means I might develop it in the future and my kids are also at risk. So I hope to adopt children.

And I hate bhakts and their logic. One can check my comment history. 

I stumbled upon this report by [ABP News](https://twitter.com/rohini_sgh/status/1336260990845915143?s=21) that says MSP isn’t all that good either. 

- Farmers tend to grow only the crops that come under MSP
- India needs pulses and imports them from outside but farmers tend to grow rice and wheat only because it is covered under MSP
- each year, huge amount of farm produce goes to waste because government is obliged to buy it from the farmers no matter what the demand
- As a result this could be a burden for the tax payer 

While I understand there are literally thousands of places where the taxpayers money is gone to waste such as -
1. Subsidized food in the parliament 
2. Various allowances that are paid to government service employees like phone bills, travel trips every four years 

But, this MSP topic is current.


That brings up a question, shouldn’t farming be more tied into the demand-supply dynamics? What’s the point of growing something that you already have surplus of? Shouldn’t the government study the international demand and incentivize the farmers to grow those crops too that can sell in the international market for good price?

This farmers bill topic is so deep, the more I read about it, the more I get confused about what’s the right. With all that said, Farmer’s right to protest shouldn’t be taken away. With how bad Modi government has historically been with defining policies of this country, I doubt BJP has thought about this all the way through.","How much of crop is purchased by the govt at msp.

This broke my Internet -> Home networking, and was hoping that IPv6 could help me sort this out. 

I reached out to ACT, but they keep calling me, and given the pandemic situation, I haven't been in a position to take their calls. I requested they reply through email, but to no avail. I clearly requested IPv6 details (roadmap, implementation etc.) but they replied like so.  

&#x200B;

>We would like to inform you that in order to connect the network from outside you need to take static ip. Kindly confirm us so that we can forward it to the concerned team for immediate action.

&#x200B;

I'm not sure what to think, do the technicians know about IPv6? I've seen some threads that point out the ill-trained support team, but at no point did they escalate this. 

Now, I do not have a twitter account to ping them over there, nor am I keen on setting up a server to VPN into my home, as in that case, I'll need to pay for the cloud-VM ingress-egress bandwidth usage. 

I've also looked into Hurricane Electric's tunnels, but they seem to require a public IP, defeating the point of a tunnel (in my case). 

What are my options now? I understand calls are the best way, but unfortunately time doesn't seem to come by. I could ping them on twitter, but had a bad experience over there, so no more. 

What do I do? How do I get IPv6 setup properly?",And why can't you take a call? Strange. Why don't you email then to arrange a time after work or at weekends? ,2020-12-08 03:38:52

It would be helpful to have something on record from Google regarding this matter.

1538,Indian Men Stare - A LOT. And that is a problem.,ixkmyk,india,769,False,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/ixkmyk/indian_men_stare_a_lot_and_that_is_a_problem/,273,Non-Political,"Even being a man I have come across men staring at most women on streets, shops, and parks in India. Any woman they see, they don't just look - they stare and check them out from head to toe. And as they walk/drive/run away, they keep leering till they are out of sight. You can visibly see the women getting uncomfortable or staring back, and some men stop gawking at this point; but many still continue to ogle shamelessly - they aren't even looking at the eyes for god's sake. 

And I do not live in a run down locality or something - this happens in South F-ing Delhi - not a posh area by any means - it's just  normal middle class lane with a series of houses in a row. There is a market nearby which is quite a popular place for eating street food and there are lots of people in our lane at all times. And this staring happens all the time by everybody in this lane. 

Whenever I'm out with my mom or sister, I can see men looking - even when we are in a car. Their bloody heads follow you as you go. And that riles me up. I always knew that all women go through this, but recently, it has started to make my blood boil. Even I don't like people glancing at me on the roads let alone leering and ogling and staring. They only stop staring at people when sometimes I look at them with a death stare. If even I find it uncomfortable, what happens to the women out there??

I can point out specific people - the person who washes the cars constantly monitors our every move whenever we leave our building. There is a clinic assistant (in a clinic nearby) who stares and does not stop at all. Construction workers on our lane ogle at women as a group - they stop their work to eye any women walking. Their's a paedo uncle next door who sits on his ground floor balcony and scouts (I've been living for 10+ years here and my sister and her friends were always told to stay away from him while growing up - he even told a small girl to sit on his lap once). Security guards of the organisation in the front of our house (the back gate faces our lane). I was once walking in a park behind my sister and a man with his gf on his lap kept staring continuously at her - I felt like punching the lights out of him. (this is one of the most poshest areas in Delhi, mind you, with 100 cr+ houses surrounding the park - but the park is public). I can't even begin to imagine what happens at more affluent levels of society where men have more power (men can earn money and power even without a proper education) and at lower levels where women are treated like shit anyways. 

When people say Western culture has a bad influence on *sanskar and shit*  what is this? As far as I know, people in public places do not stare like that. Staring is a part of the culture of this subcontinent.  And I feel it is somewhat restricted to cities and towns in North India because of the pathetic condition of women's rights in *some* states. Especially those surrounding Delhi. I have lived in Mumbai too, and I don't think I have even seen such levels of staring in any other city. Chennai-nope to little. Mum-little to a lot. Kolkata-little. Small towns-almost none. But to be clear - it exists in small towns - one of my friends got his butt squeezed in a bus in a small town despite being a man - think what happens to women, in bigger cities? Staring happens in villages too, but I think in villages it is more out of concern since everybody knows literally everybody. It transforms into leering and ogling once these people move into towns and cities - it transforms from concern to sexual thoughts to violent thoughts. Most men in India do not have any contact with women throughout adolescence and that leads to this shit. 

The main point is, if these men don't have the sense to stop looking when women get uncomfortable, other, more serious things like groping, and all crimes against women are more common than we think even if we don't notice them. Men need to be shown their place when they stare, but I don't know how to discourage it besides staring back.

1541,"Arranged Marriage, a Rant",k4ljid,india,109,False,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/k4ljid/arranged_marriage_a_rant/,76,Non-Political,"I know there  are some who will come at me with 'But in pRoGrEsSiVe FaMiLiEs arranged marriages just mean that your family sets you up with someone and then lets you date'. Fair, that's genuinely great, but the vast majority of people in India right now and even plenty of Indians abroad do not come from backgrounds that could even remotely be described as 'progressive'. I am talking about everyone else, who are not quite as lucky. I make my case:

1. It encourages coloursim and viewing members of the opposite sex as objects and resources. The lighter-skinned a woman is, the more options she has- education, personality and other preferences be damned. The more money a man makes, the more options he has. Women are viewed as free house help that also has to look pretty and fuck her husband and risk her life having his babies while men are...literal banks. When you are choosing your spouse from an online catalog (matrimonial sites) the way you'd shop for furniture, you cannot take chemistry and personality into account.

2. It is a recipe for disaster in a culture that stigmatizes divorce. My parents met each other in person twice before their wedding. TWICE. 2 times. I would vet my fucking *roommates* better than this. Neither of them had any idea what they were in for and now they're stuck together and have been for 30 miserable years. I cannot recall a single time they were genuinely happy, nor have I seen a single happy couple in my family except for one- an aunt who was basically disowned for marrying a man of a different religion, and her husband.

3. It is sexually regressive. If I'm being real, anyone traditional enough to marry a stranger because their astrology charts match up is not going to be good at discussing sex. Does the man even know what a clitoris is? Does he care (likely not)? Do they have similar, or compatible views on porn, open relationships, cheating? Are the couple even aware sex should be pleasant and not painful? I know women who aren't even aware that it's not wrong for women to *feel horny*, let alone masturbate or have sex. This is traditional, 'typical', non upper-class Indian society.

4. It promotes insular societies. People will not marry outside their religion/caste/social class in arranged marriages. Why? They are either afraid of people different to them, or genuinely think they're inferior. I think that loving somebody, whether romantic or platonic, is the highest form of accepting their humanity. If you cannot accept that someone of your caste/religion/etc. loving someone of another is not a sin or transgression, then how non-discriminatory are you, really?

This is off the top of my head, but I have a lot more. I remember being 15 or 16 and crying in bed at night thinking I only had another decade (if lucky) to live before having to look the possibility of marrying a stranger and having to bear his babies in the eyes.

Yet Make In India remains a failure. And the government seems perplexed as to why.

The reality is that our policymakers have a very crude understanding of manufacturing. They grossly overestimate fixed resources and fail to understand the importance of supply chains - the sole reason why China is winning.

Unless you're making extremely simple goods (like, say matchsticks), every product you make will be made up of multiple parts. The more advanced the product, the more parts it will have. 

There is no factory in the world that can make all the parts needed for a complex product. You will need to source different parts from different factories, often located across the world.

If you want to make your product efficiently, you need to ensure that ALL parts reach you a) on time and b) predictably.

The latter is extremely important. If you're a manufacturer, you NEED to know that a shipment will reach your factory every 30 days without delay. 

As any project manager will tell you, a small delay in one task can lead to long delays in all the tasks that depend on it. If you're making a cellphone, if the microprocessor doesn't reach you from Taiwan in time, the entire manufacturing process is held up.

This is the bit where India loses out heavily.

Our supply chains are simply not consistent enough and predictable enough. If you import a component, there is no guarantee that it will reach your factory in X number of days. Depending on the traffic at the port, the whims of the customs agents, and the traffic on the highway from the port to the factory, your shipment might reach you in X+Y days.

A myriad number of things can arbitrarily delay shipments in India. The government might change import duties or impose restrictions randomly (as it has done recently), destroying established supplier relationships. The customs agents can hold up a shipment for any arbitrary reason. Some protestors might hold up the highway, creating a logjam. 

This unpredictability is anathema to modern manufacturing, where speed and efficiency are paramount, not fixed costs. China's share of global manufacturing has gone UP recently despite rising labor costs. And it's happened because unlike its competitors, China understands that the most important thing for manufacturers is stable and predictable supply chains.

As long as India ignores this crucial issue, Make In India will continue to fail. Land and labor and laws are important, but it's even more important to remove arbitrariness in laws, bureaucracy in customs, and unpredictability in transport.","Japan has a really good system.

1. I have two maids, one that makes almost alright food (vegetarian) everyday and another that has OCD and cleans everything and takes care of the entire house quite well. I live in pretty small but airy flat(owned) in a very chill city. Although it's a Tier 2 city I still have most of the condiments and other things that I would need to prepare some kind of an American dinner if I wanted.



2. I basically have a plate of food ready when I want it and have loads of snacks and chocolates etc. I have a microwave oven, an induction stove and an Air-fryer which I use to heat up the food appropriately whenever desired. Also, Grocery is taken care of too, and most daily things can be ordered now over Amazon/jio/nature's basket etc.



3. My mum and dad are both Managers in a public sector company and have a respectable salary with considerable perks. My dad has contacts of specific helpers like electricians, carpenter, plumber etc that he calls whenever there's any problem in the house and pretty much gets it gets it fixed instantly (this is from own pocket, not office). This is something that'll cost you tonnes in a developed country. Also, I live with my parents during Covid so I don't need to worry about anything whatsoever.



4.  I myself have a fairly well paying job in the in the IT sector after having graduated through advanced degrees in an Elite college (compare it to the unaffordability of a good University in the US). Coupled with strong purchasing power, we can afford most small things easily. I have the freedom of leaving my job for a research career without a pay and then moving on to a hefty and often costly master's degree abroad (which I'm looking forward to, since Indian higher education sucks ass)



5. I was lucky enough in my childhood to have had trainings in art, music and dance for 8+ years without any hindrance. This was again quite cheap and the music teacher came to my home to teach me at an accelerated pace. Then I joined engineering coaching classes which were also so really fun and far more knowledge dispersing and stimulating than any standard 11-12th curriculum in the world, I would say. Doesn't necessarily translate to it being useful, I know, but still.



6. I can score 'stuff' pretty cheap and easy and have lots of friends open to sharing the joy. I've done my research on psychedelics so don't pick up on this. I've had the fortune and time and privelege to wonder, think and read about philosophy, psychology and the inner (and outer?) workings of the universe and conscious life. I know most of these things would be possible and encouraged in the developed countries with an upper middle class life too, as in India it's actually quite rare. I have the freedom to be vagrant and useless.

____________

**CONS**


General cons are lack of international food (eg BBQ - absent), extreme pollution, Corruption, extreme HEAT, traffic woes, widespread stupidity and rashness, overpopulation, competition and poor education.

One thing I brood over is the lack of concerts in India. I have my taste leaning in prog and Jazz etc and such artists won't ever come to India, and Music is a big part of my Life.

I won't say crime, because I think I am shielded from it because of my privilege, you might be more afraid of gun-weilding goons in the US than here.

Another I can think of is lack of good mental health support. I have an authoritative, narcissistic dad and that has given me issues. Depression, mild ADHD, chronic procrastination etc. Still struggling.

Plus there is an inherent racism(colour) and classism that exists in India that gets spotted with merely clothes and overall shabbiness, fluency in English etc that keeps you away from people not similar to your background. This might come off as offensive, but it's practiced subconsciously by almost everyone.



.....................

So, is this the epitome of a comfortable life? I know there are so many things that would be better off in the developed World along with stability and more opportunities to grow in career, but **I wish to know how better or worse does it get once you move to** US (unique experiences due to Visa issues) / Canada (collddd) / EU (free stuff etc) / any other country.

PS: This isn't any form of bragging. Sorry if you didn't like the naive tone. Take it as gratefulness and counting my blessings as I am growing up (I'm 23). And please help with a detailed comparison of specific points that'll help me decide about my future career.",You forgot to mention another important thing that adds value to your quality of life....women. You can be going out with a different woman every single week. In India not so much unless you are elite. ,2020-11-23 19:15:58

My question is: do we know for certain if any of the so called ""cage free"" eggs available in India are actually so? Is there any way to be sure?

I came across few different brands in Nature's Basket which claim to be ""cage free"" (Rs 20/egg) but I didn't know if I could trust them.","There's no conclusive evidence that taste differs significantly between caged and uncaged eggs. And even if you can tell the difference, I don't think there's any reason to spend 4x the price. Nutritional value, I agree though.

Furthermore, a cage-free environment does not guarantee freedom. What you're looking for are pasture raised eggs. ""Cage-free"" eggs that came from a cramped chicken coop are still caged eggs, imo.

# tl;dr

Replies to Right to Information requests filed with the Delhi Police, the Kolkata Police and the Telangana State Technology Services shed light on how these public authorities are using their facial recognition technology systems.  


# Delhi Police

In a [**reply**](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1iR8Mw1uCoCTLTVWvEQVp1bNvuGruTxgQ/view?usp=sharing) dated November 25, 2020 to a Right to Information [**request**](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1HTCZt-HkRedEDT_s4kG66UNFXUryw6hy/view?usp=sharing) filed on October 23, 2020 with reference no. DEPOL/R/E/20/07128, the Office of the Deputy Commissioner of Police cum Public Information Officer: Crime has stated that they cannot share the requisite information about the facial recognition technology system being used by the Delhi Police u/s 8(d) of the Right to Information Act, 2005.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/zsjkxnlzii261.png?width=1600&format=png&auto=webp&s=8f956f7c482c7b91ab0510c9902d2bcfdfc3c6cf

Since there is no S. 8(d) of the RTI Act, we assume that the PIO was referring to [**S. 8(1)(d)**](https://indiankanoon.org/doc/1001313/) of the Act which states that:  


>Notwithstanding anything contained in this Act, there shall be no obligation to give any citizen, information including commercial confidence, trade secrets or intellectual property, the disclosure of which would harm the competitive position of a third party, unless the competent authority is satisfied that larger public interest warrants the disclosure of such information;  


This could mean that the system may be exploited in the future for some commercial use. It also means that certain commercial/proprietary rights may be vested with the third parties themselves. This calls into question the motivation of the company supplying the technology, in this case Innefu Labs Pvt. Ltd., who have access to the data collected by the Delhi Police. Since we do not have any information about any privacy protections put in place by the Delhi Police to protect the data of the citizens of Delhi, the concern that the data collected may be accessed by Innefu without the consent of the citizens to whom the data belongs and be processed further for commercial purposes arises.  


# Kolkata Police

In a [**reply**](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1uRlbV0Grz7Vk4zwuNOm7pBIxCiARfKOx/view?usp=sharing) dated November 18, 2020 to a Right to Information request ([**link**](https://drive.google.com/file/d/14qS7jWAqucdN-cIzbvBojCjixzCJ6TPf/view); see page 25) dated July 30, 2020, the Office of the Commissioner, Kolkata Police has stated that that the information pertaining to their facial recognition technology system that we asked for relates to their Detective department and that the department was exempted from disclosure under the [**RTI Act u/s 24(4)**](https://indiankanoon.org/doc/1767825/).

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/27edt6x1ji261.png?width=1600&format=png&auto=webp&s=1ffd37e560cebf413ce323313747ce45e2963d06

Section 24(4) of the RTI Act states that “certain organisations” such as intelligence and security organisations do not come under the purview of the act and can be exempted from disclosure if the government specifically exempts them by notification in the Official Gazette. This means that the Kolkata Police is using facial recognition technology without there being any avenue through which transparency and accountability can be demanded from them for their use of such an invasive technology.  


# Telangana State Technology Services (TSTS)

In a [**reply**](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1eCJOCGNkaHMC1VWHfvEDfHvhdDk8S_Wy/view?usp=sharing) dated November 11, 2020 to a Right to Information [**request**](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1LLt9LhDGkZgLdWPapbJPR0Wj0ojsT6Li/view?usp=sharing) dated October 23, 2020 the Telangana State Technology Services has stated that the results of using facial recognition technology system for authentication of voters with an accuracy rate of 80% was satisfactory. They also stated that they had no plans to take any steps to improve the accuracy of the system.

&#x200B;

I'm a Commodities and F&O trader with 5 years of experience in the Indian financial markets. I have been operating profitably with my first year being the only exception, with a CAGR of over 100% in the last 4 years. Recently my mentee, who I mentored for 2 years has completed his training and has become an independent trader. In that period I've helped him build up his financial knowledge from absolute scratch to a point where he's a full time trader and has been profitable for the last year and a half, doing just as good as me. I found my mentor on Reddit and so this is a way of giving back.

&#x200B;

**Why this may not for you if -**

* You are a free spirit who thinks following the rules aren't meant for you.
* You are in need of some get rich quick scheme.
* You get emotional regarding money.
* You like to count your chickens before they hatch.
* You like to listen to the crowd over your intuitions.
* You hate reading books/online material.

&#x200B;

**This may be for you if -**

* You are hard working
* You are looking for financial Independence.
* You are a process oriented person, not a result oriented one.
* You are extremely disciplined.
* You are calm under pressure.

&#x200B;

**What's absolutely required -**

* Deploy-able capital of 5 lacs.
* 2 hours of free time every day.

&#x200B;

**Preferred but not required -**

* Prior knowledge of the financial markets
* Based in Gurgaon(I'm based there)/NCR.

&#x200B;

**This is a one year program**. You alone will be making the trades in your trading account and I'll only be interjecting when absolutely required. There are no upfront costs. Though I am considering taking a share of the first year profits. I will turn you into a profitable trader in a year doing just as well as me, if not better.

He ends it with - 

> Despite the West Indies being such a dominant force in the game till the start of the century and also being twice winners of the ICC World Twenty20 events, there’s not a single West Indian even in the thoughts of the franchises for a coaching assignment. We, still, would have an inexperienced Australian as assistant coach but a West Indian? No way.

> Those two ICC Twenty20 trophies by the West Indians and the emergence of the Indian cricket team as a force in all forms of the game under Ravi Shastri and Co should be proof enough that other colours also can make champions.

> Stop being brainwashed and being complexed.

Why is this racist piece of shit being given a platform to speak on racism? 

From his Autobiography Sunny Days -

> ""To call the crowd a 'crowd' in Jamaica is a 
misnomer. It should be called a 'mob'. The way 
they shrieked and howled every time Holding 
bowled was positively horrible. They encouraged 
him with shouts of 'Kill him, Maaaan!' 'Hit im 
Maan!', Knock his head off Mike!' All this proved 
beyond a shadow of doubt that these people still 
belonged to the jungles and forests, instead of a 
civilised country.. 


> Their partisan attitude was even more evident 
when they did not applaud any shots we played. 
At one stage I even 'demanded' claps for a 
boundary shot off Daniel. All I got was laughter 
from the section, which certainly hadn't 
graduated from the trees where they belonged... 


> They were stamping their legs, clapping and 
jumping with joy. The only word I can think of to 
describe the behaviour of the crowd is 
'barbarian'. Here was a man seriously injured, 
and these barbarians were thirsting for more 
blood, instead of expressing sympathy, as any 
civilised and sporting crowd would have done.... 


> The whole thing was sickening. Never have I 
seen such cold-blooded and positively 
indifferent behaviour from cricket officials and 
the spectators, to put it mildly, were positively 
inhuman.""   
- Sunil Gavaskar, Sunny Days (1976)","For those who want to know the context to the whole thing:

The incident referred to was the 4th Test on the 1976 tour at Sabina Park - the series was tied at 1-1 with India coming off the back of a then record chase of 406 to win on the back of Gavaskar & Vishwanath centuries. 

India was 178-1 at the end of 1st day’s play and next day WI bowlers started attacking the body of the Indian batters. 

Michael Holding himself stated - ‘On that surface it was inevitable that some batsmen would be hit against such a pace-based attack as ours, especially as we adopted the tactic of bowling round the wicket, aiming the ball at their bodies. I was not too keen on this method since it gives the batsman little chance of avoiding a bouncer, but it was 1–1 in the series and we were under extreme public pressure to win' Source - the book Grovel! by David Tossell. 

Vishwanath had a broken finger, Bedi was hit in the face, back to back hits on Anshuman Gaekwad’s face was when the crowd chanted kill him mike kill him & Gaekwad was hit on his ear, the crowd cheered & taken to the hospital.

It’s quite obvious a team mate getting that sort of a treatment is going to irk anyone. 

The West Indians have special affection for Gavaskar, a calypso was also dedicated to him. 

This dolt is just trying to tarnish a man’s legacy on account of his half baked hit job. ",2020-07-11 01:03:22

Happy Onam to all!

This is a good time to remember the  Onappattu that will be reverberating around Kerala now - the song that  kindles memories of how things used to be when Maaveli was King, before  he was unjustly sent to the Netherworld through trickery.“When Maaveli  was ruling the land, all humans were equal”. Then the rest of the  stanza: “They lived happily and there was no danger to anyone.”“There  were no worries and no diseases. Evil people were nowhere to be  seen.""""There were none around other than  people of goodness. There were no lies, and no cheating and no false  promises. There were no false measures or crooked weights and no other  falsities either.”Notice that the song says nothing about Maaveli  himself, neither his physical powers nor his generosity or other  personal qualities. The song only talks about the kind of society that  flourished when he was around.The fulcrum of the song, therefore, is  about social relations.Equal dignity of all individuals. Fairness,  justice and lack of lies and cheating when people deal with each other.  There couldn’t be a better articulation of the ideal society.Remember  that during much of the recent centuries, Kerala was no haven of  equality or fairness or justice. It was, as Vivekananda called it, a  “madhouse” - of caste supremacy, extreme inequality and prejudice. But  the song kept the flame alive.And so did the Maaveli story. Ideas, as  they say, have consequences. So the next time anyone wonders why Kerala  is what it is, one could say: may be Onam had a lot to do with it!The  Maaveli story with its distinctive sympathies, is not a one-off.Some of  the folk dance performances of Kerala, like Theyyattam, are built around  the stories of those who were punished with death for infringing caste  rules.These performances deified those who were thus killed and kept  them alive.Onam in that sense is also a yearly performance that revolts  against forgetting, and sets up the right ideals for a society to strive  towards.Onam comes around every year because Malayalis haven’t reached  those ideals yet. But they’re on the way. Come hell - or high water!

1584,The Bitter Truth of Equality Before Law..,jvqj4q,india,89,False,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/jvqj4q/the_bitter_truth_of_equality_before_law/,25,AskIndia,"At 8 am(6th November,2020) on the Ajmer Elevated Road in Jaipur, 2 girls were playing ***at a speed of 100 kmph***, Hit a young man ***30 feet from the road***, who fell on the roof of a nearby house. The young man died on the spot. The accused has been identified as the daughter-in-law of Vimal Soni, the owner of Soni hospital. The cops have seized the vehicle. A case has also been registered under the Indian Penal Code (IPC) Sections 279 (rash driving), and 304A (death due to negligence). ***The police have not arrested any of the accused and instead allowed them to return home***.  

After reading this News, I was aghast and i wished for worst for her. But deep down I knew that the system will protect her, and nothing will happen to her as normally happens in Our Country where if accused have some big links, or belongs to Rich powerful family then  they are consider above law, thus mocking and murdering and violating the very first fundamental right given in Indian Constitution, i.e. Equality Before Law(Article 14)

Then I Searched for the different Road accidents which i remembered. These accidents Involve a Rich teen(Girl/Boy) and killed person belongs to a very Poor family or does Not have links.

1.  ***50-year-old homeless woman was mowed down*** by a speeding SUV, allegedly driven by a young woman***(Shreya Aggarwal,20years***), and was dragged for close to 300 metres.22nd Aug 2018
2.  ***A 68-year-old security guard was run over*** by a car driven by ***18-year-old girl*** (Aparna) a resident of the complex and daughter of a real estate businessman. 3rd September 2020
3.  ***A tourist from Turkmenistan died*** while two others were injured after a Bentley Bentayga rammed into their autorickshaw. The driver of the car is said to be ***19-year-old*** Asees Singh Chadha(Nephew of Ponty Chaddha) 19th Feb, 2019

So, common thing among Murderer is Rash Driving, High Status Young Blood, and all murdered belongs to poor families.

I tried to analyse the ***reasons behind these Accidents*** to reach to the Concluding Part that Inequality before Law Prevails in our country.

As it is the ***Behavior*** of these Young People which is leading to Accidents and Killing of Poor People. This Behavior Includes Rash Driving, Not Following Traffic Rules etc. But the Question is ***What is Activating This Behavior***????

1. The belief that their parents will not let anything happen to them, even if they will do anything wrong. Money can buy anything and they know that ***system reciprocate in same manner***. 
2. They must have seen the pampering by the System itself.

That's why  even after reading about the cases happened due to rash driving, they don't give a damn about it. They fearlessly breaks Traffic rules. They Don't treat poor as equals and so Does the system.

you replace killed one with a rich one, and tell me, will the system reciprocate, or will handle the case in same manner???  

legislative, executive and judiciary, all three organs are equally responsible for this Inequality.

Today i am deeply hurt by thinking about these people of our country who has the responsibility of maintaining law and  order and to provide equality to every citizen. 

I think they have failed miserably and situation is not going to change in future.

Sorry, i have written a long post, but this is what i think. what do you guys think about the reasons of prevailing inequality in our society, if it exist, and how can we achieve equality for our freedom fighters who fought for equal, prosperous India.","Rich people don't go to jail anywhere , there are numerous examples in all places ",2020-11-17 18:06:42
1585,Indigo flight to chandigarh overbooked passengers stranded.,ea0iu4,india,269,False,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/ea0iu4/indigo_flight_to_chandigarh_overbooked_passengers/,39,Unverified,"So, flight 6E 592 from Bangalore to Chandigarh Indigo airlines has been overbooked by indigo. These guys came to know about this when boarding bus was at the door of aircraft with 50-70 passengers still in boarding bus. 

We have kept the flight stranded for now.

But such irresponsible behaviour from indigo has left all of us in jiffy. We are standing at tarmac currently.

Will update.

Please upvote this for visibility. These are such malicious practices. How can they have overbooked so much.

Update1: so indigo guys scheduled same flight to two different places instead of two. And passengers for other location (I couldn't get that) have not be allowed to board.
Now they have boarded all the Chandigarh passengers.
But rest are still stranded. I am on board but still there are atleast 30 people stranded. This is some pathetic show by indigo

Also I am not sure whether i will get my luggage today.

Okay will update after I reach Chandigarh airplane mode time. Hope these guys don't remain stranded here for long.

Real shit show by indigo

Update 2: Reached Chandigarh got my luggage.

About the whole fiasco. Seems like those passengers were going to Amritsar and Indigo cancelled their flights and tried to put them on Chandigarh flight and a further passage to Amritsar. Now due to almost complete show by Chandigarh passengers ,Amritsar guys were stopped from boarding.
TLDR: seems like indigo miscalculated the no show and caused stranded passengers
 Edit: https://www.flightstats.com/v2/flight-tracker/6E/592

Since some are doubting this story. Above is flight stats link for the flight. 40min delay was due to this whole drama. Now I am hoping someone comes up with video or news of this. Should have taken the pics",Did the people complain and can u guys get to fly free? ,2019-12-13 14:47:56

I am not from the IT world so a lot of it does not make sense to me but despite this I know that whitehat and Byju's are terrible to say the least. I am from the commerce background and today I came to know about JuniorMBA by a company called Clever Harvey ([https://www.cleverharvey.com](https://www.cleverharvey.com)).

Their pitch - "" Clever Harvey's programs for 21st Century  Skills bridge the gap between academics and the real world and help  every learner compete globally. ""

Their founder Sriram Subramanian has said “Before we buy a car, we test drive it. Before we buy a full scoop of ice cream, we ask for a taster. Before we pick a career, we only rely on someone else’s advice? Coding has offered an interesting early preview into tech careers, but we found that there is no equivalent for the business world. Thus, we launched the JuniorMBA. It has been so fulfilling to see the joy on our students’ faces at understanding the corporate world, and the relief for the parents as they see their teen get career clarity"". Source - [https://m.timesofindia.com/spotlight/now-a-juniormba-to-help-teenagers-get-career-clarity/articleshow/78424705.cms](https://m.timesofindia.com/spotlight/now-a-juniormba-to-help-teenagers-get-career-clarity/articleshow/78424705.cms)

As per their site they offer 3 courses - JuniorCEO, Junior CMO & JuniorCTO. All 3 courses have 10 classes.

JuniorCEO -  In 10 classes, learn to lead with the entrepreneurship and decision-making skills of a **Chief Executive Officer**.

JuniorCMO -  In 10 classes, influence the world with the strategic communication skills of a **Chief Marketing Officer.** 

JuniorCTO -  In 10 classes, go beyond just coding and build the analytical and problem-solving skills of a **Chief Technology Officer.**

They are targeting teens with this. You could argue that this is not as bad as whitehat but it is. Their Youtube channel has a showcase videos of their successful Alumnis and one of the products showcased is called Shield Pulse - a ""smart band"" that notifies the owner of a property if their watchman fell asleep while on duty. The video is disturbing to me because the kids in the video talk about this ""problem"" and have zero empathy.

She just graduated from an IIT(one of the most prestigious institutes in the country)despite being raised in an *extremely* patriarchal environment. Only my mummy supported her and she was always denied resources and they were given to me, something I have realised way too late. I want to make it right now. She has been dating this guy and I think she wants to marry him, and this is where things have gone to shit 


Relatives(joint family)want her to have an arranged marriage. They always  had this plan about us, about having arranged marriages.They recently brought it up 


She is extremely depressed I want to know if I can do anything to help her, this sub is the epitome of female empowerment please just tell me what to say to her she is extremely isolated and I don't know how to get to her I really just want her to get better, what do I tell her??? She's not talking to anyone. She wants to do an MBA and then get married to her guy, but that means literally cutting her family off. She has an option of running away, I can get her some money to start it off around 25,000 I can sell my phone. But I just need to talk to her about it she's not responding.

I have been surfing feminist subs since two hours and seen many desi women, pls just tell me how to help her I have no idea what she's going through, I am just locked in my room I have no clue what to do. Please literally any suggestions would help especially if you're from india
PS I am copy pasting this on various subs,


25/11/2020 she is recovering quickly, she talked to mummy and when papa comes home tonight the four of us will have a talk.
See the thing is, she wanted to do an MBA right after graduation. She told me people first get a job and then do MBA, but she wanted a head start. She was preparing for that MBA exam, it's CAT I think.
And parents just assumed that she'll get married and then keep doing what she wants, so when she told them about her ""friend"" they freaked out, especially papa. My sister has always been the ""good girl"", she was excellent in studies and never caused trouble. I think bcoz this image of her is now shaken my father is in denial. The extended family doesn't know much, only the fact that my sister does not want to marry now and if she does, she has a preference(they don't know much about that. Only mamaji(uncle) knows the full story bcoz mummy told him, and he won't tell anyone. Please don't be harsh on the family, they are extremely conservative and something like this is just not something they are used to handling. I will update when something of consequence happens. Also sister does not want to run away(yet) she thinks its too desparate.

EDIT: Thank you everyone for all your responses, it's been quite a few days since this post and tbh I kinda forgot about these posts lmao sorry.
In short, sister has talked to papa and he's ready to postpone her marriage a bit forward(a few years at least). Buuuutttt he doesn't want her to do an MBA, he wants her to crack UPSC, it's a civil services examination that will enable her to be a beurocrat(in my family there's HUGE respect for that exam). So there's still that issue, but at least she's not being forced to marry right now. I have a feeling that the shit storm isn't over, just delayed. But I am positive that she will be able to convince everyone of her choice. She was able to convince papa and that means she might be able to do it again in the future. Tbh I am just happy I won't have to see my sister run away. I even showed her these posts and she called me an idiot :-[
Anyways, thanks for all your responses, I got some pretty great tips and frankly it just helped me cope with all this. Oh and one more thing,sister's bf actually had some plans for civil services in the future! So if he was to ever become a beurocrat that would be a big plus and I think it would be a lot easier to convince the family.
Thank you everyone 🙏","Meet her in person and tell her that you will support her no matter what she chooses. Also ask her to wait for 3-4 years before getting married. She should focus on her career first. 

Lot of college love don't end in marriage, so you need to be on her side if that happens. Most family members have a ""I told you so"" attitude towards failed love stories. But when an arranged marriage fails, its always bad luck. ",2020-11-24 19:39:44

There are way more comics coming in everyday than earlier. Now that the comics like AIB and EIC have shown that stand-up comedy can be a viable career, many ppl are trying to make it a career. Nothing wrong in that. The problem arises when the content becomes monotonous and juiceless. Saw the comicistaan, had a small hope it would bring in new ppl into scene. But all they did was milking the whole comedy scenario in india. A few good comics came out. Now they have started a new comedy series. 

Most of the comics are restricted to topics like girlfriends, exes, insulting IITs, insulting audience and women comics often make period jokes. I mean, that's what it all has come up to. When aib and EIC were at their prime, they had a variety of content, comics like rivaldo, Kunal were doing political jokes, while Zakir Khan was into comedy about dating scene. Now I hit stand up comedy in youtube, all i get is the same content by different comics. 

I have tried to see bill burr, his comedy never gets boring coz, he changes his content very often. I hope this scene changes and we get more variety content.

On 25th of July this year I bought a laptop from official Acer India estore for 50k. I had to buy the laptop from their estore as I was not able to get the laptop with the specific configuration that I need from Flipkart or Amazon. Paid the full amount.

On 30th July I received the system and lo and behold there was a gapping in the bezel of the laptop. I turned on the system and the system used to crash while trying to go to sleep. I immediately called their helpline and they told me to email to register a case. The lady on the line suggested that there might be software issue and to update the drivers and created a case for the gapping in the bezel.

I immediately told them about their return policy which in clearly written on site that they should be informed about within 7 days of delivery. These guys refused to replace or refund me on my system. They said the system will be serviced. I sent them countless mails and calls and no one listened and they proceeded to fix the bezel of my laptop.

Meanwhile I had updated the system to the latest drivers and the issue of system crashing had not solved. The service center took the system and formatted it and told me the issue was solved. I checked and the issue was not solved. Their tech from somewhere in India even remoted and checked the system and saw that the system was updated.

In the meantime I stilled called support number and they said to get a DOA certificate from the service center, the service center blatantly refused as it ""not their policy"". Then I talked so some head in Delhi and he says that DOA can only be processed if its reported within 7 days of invoice date. WTF! the invoice date is 25 the date of order and 30th is the date of delivery, what kind of policy is that? But still their site states 7 days from delivery but these thieves are still not providing me with a replacement laptop.

To this day the system is with the service center and they call me saying that the system is fixed. When I remote and check via Anydesk, the system had crashed. It clearly is shown in Event Viewer.

Its been 4 months and nothing is still happening. I have put my grievance in National Consumer Helpline and no action has been taken. I bought a system to work on and these people took my money and I have nothing in return for 4 months. What gives? I had bought the machine with my 5 months stipend and these people have no heart!

These people are hell bent on giving me a defective and factory refurbished machine which it has become.

What should I do?

Advice for Shoppers, never buy electronics from dedicated brand stores. Always get from a online dealer like Flipkart Amazon etc  or offline dealer, never a brand shop.

**Update 1**: Found e-mail & numbers of multiple people involved in Acer, called multiple persons. CEO's number was unavailable but sent him an e-mail. Automatic e-mail came he is out of office till 8th January 2021 next year and told me to contact his assistant for urgent matters. Sent to her. No response.

Next I sent mails to the highest authorities in the company and started calling people from top down to bottom. Head people didn't pick up my call. Regional Manager of North picked up the phone and acknowledged my issue and he said that he'll look in the matter. He said to wait till Monday for a promising update.

Next then during daytime I received a call from technical head of region and he's saying that he's asked the service center to send the machine to him and he'll fix it personally. He's offered me with a warranty extension of 4 months on the machine but is still is adamant to fix the machine.

TL;DR I'm still being bullied by the company. I am not getting my refund or replacement on my order.",". >I turned on the system and the system used to crash

I am a US citizen and travelled to hyderabad, India in July 2015 from USA. I had a one way flight to Jeddah from Hyderabad and returning from Jeddah to USA. At Hyderabad airport, the check-in agent will not let me check in stating that immigration requires all passengers going to Saudi Arabia to have roundtrip tickets. I explained to him that I am not an Indian citizen and cannot return to India as I do not have visa to return. He inisited that I buy the ticket or else he is clsoing the counter and I cannot catch the flight. I bought a fully refundable ticket at the airport for return and cancelled the ticket in Riyadh, KSA. The Air India in Riyadh said that I have to go back to the place I bought the ticket to get a refund. 

After returning to USA I lodged a complaint with Discover card serves and asked for refund.

Air India refused to refund the money stating that the ticket was cancelled but no refund.

Discover card has charged me interested on the tiket charges and there is no response from Air India. In 2016, I went back to India on a visit and asked the people at the airport for the refund and they could not even pull up the ticket information and they do not know what to do.

Air India staff suggested that I post o Reddit for AIr India to take action.

I was brought up in a fairly developed township in Ghaziabad and lived in an apartment. (This maybe different then the Delhi experience where u have a few parks and sporting facilities). When we were kids we were always nagged by elders, who were used to occupy the space in the park. They used to constantly scold us, take our equipment, complain to our parents by not letting us play football, cricket etc. It was so annoying. We were used to fight with them a lot and during our childhood we somehow managed to play in the park tho it was never fun as we had to be on the lookout for the elderly or not breaking something. The society administration was annoyed becasue us playing made the park go bald so they built a circular flower garden in the middle. By this point we were already tired and only played in the park a few times. Soon playing got replaced by awaaragardi around town. That was bad becasue physical activity really is important as sports are mostly not taken that seriously in Indian schools. Also this was the same story in every society and we didn't had any parks near us to play. The nearest public park or the ""Swarnajayanti Park"" was a huge park but had little hills on it so we couldn't play there. Neither we had a sports complex or something and Ghaziabad is a huge district as well. I left that society after a while and I returned a few days ago as my parents had to meet the neighbors. It was evening and no one was in the park. The park now have beautiful grass, and the flower garden in the middle looks amazing as well. But the silence in the dark and no signs of life in the park was plain depressing to me? What is a park where lively children aren't playing? I really felt sad. Modern society keeps degrading infront of my eyes. Maybe the kids are too busy on their phones. I think its also a parental problem as well. Parents of reddit, if your child's knee isn't scrapped every week you really need to question how you are bringing them up. And if anyone of you devoid other children of playing in the park you really are a scum of the earth and every kid despise you.

Edit: The first round was a draw. 2 Indian players lost on time in the second round; this was attributed to a global outage that also impacted chess.com.

I had gone just one turn away from my house, and then I bumped into an Innova in front of me.. the Innova had also braked.I don't fully recall though if it was the driver's fault or mine, there was a little dent and scratch on the back plastic guard, and it was unusual bumper to bumper traffic ahead of us.

Driver said he will call owner till then told me to wait. I told him I have to go somewhere, and that it's a minor thing, still I waited. When the owner came he said its too much of work, it is new vehicle etc (I looked it up online, the plastic part would be around 3-4k).

They checked my vehicle too, and found it dented, but I told him it was caused much earlier. All there was due to today's impact was a little white paint from the Innova plastic part. I had to give them my name, mobile, vehicle number, but I have the driver's number only, not the owner's.

I asked the guy his name, and looked him up on fb, also checked his vehicle number on RTO site. Found that the guy is a wrestler and son of a local rural NCP politician..the types who flaunt their wealth.. and that the vehicle is registered in the father's name. 

In the end I told him that I braked still it hit, I apologised many times and even told him I didn't do it purposely, had it been my fault I would have ran off right away, he said we will see..not that he threatened me in any way but I'm really tensed after discovering this info about him.

1727,[Show India] DIY Cheaper Air Purifier,jofmlz,india,27,True,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/jofmlz/show_india_diy_cheaper_air_purifier/,13,Science/Technology,"&#x200B;

Hey fine folks of /r/india, this post is my **own experiment** of building a cheaper DIY air purifier as like most of you, I too live in a highly polluted city. Although one can buy an air-purifier directly, I feel the basic version would cost about 40-50%, and should be sufficient for most of our needs.

The presented version here is without any fancy electronics, anyone with basic craft can build it and costs around INR 4500 assuming one buys all the spare parts new from the links.

&#x200B;

**Disclaimer before I begin:** I am **not** an expert in air-purifiers or any of the technology used for it. The stuff I've built is fairly simple with parts which you can either buy online or salvage it from an old hardware. I'll be posting links to where you can avail the spare parts, but again, I don't endorse anyone to buy it from there, I'm not affiliated with any company or any product. My only intention is to make use of my relatively expensive engineering degree, and inadvertently help someone. Lastly, one only needs to have the knowledge of how to buy things online, and assemble it with some duct-tape, glue and scissors.

&#x200B;

This post will cover:

* How to build a basic air purifier using HEPA filter which will be able to clean your air in your room of PM2.5 and PM10. PM 2.5 & PM10 are the particulate matter suspended in the air which cause the most damage to our lungs. (ref: [Inhalable Particulate Matter & Health](https://ww2.arb.ca.gov/resources/inhalable-particulate-matter-and-health))
* I'll give you the empirical measurements from my setup, so one can estimate the time they have to keep their air-purifier ON for their own room.
* Closing thoughts

&#x200B;

# Let's get started:

Step 1: Sourcing the items for a basic air-purifier:

1. 1X HEPA filter:As the name suggests, this is the filter which most of the air purifiers use. I would recommend getting  [Mi HEPA filter](https://www.amazon.in/Mi-Purifier-Filter-Compatible-Purifiers/dp/B0811V9S2Z/ref=sr_1_3?dchild=1&keywords=mi+air+purifier+filter&qid=1604560587&sr=8-3)  because of its shape and performance. I've used it for my purifier and it works well for me.
2. 1X 12 V High speed BLDC Fan:This is the fan which will suck the air from your room and pass it through the HEPA filter thereby cleaning the air of PM2.5. Now here's the thing, the more powerful fan you get, the faster your room will be cleaned, but also it will cost you more. I would recommend getting a bldc fan [like this.](https://www.aliexpress.com/i/33036860257.html) I couldn't find any links on amazon, but [this fan](https://www.amazon.in/PGSA2Z-BFB1012VH-Winds-Industrial-Blower/dp/B08GJ55TQ7/ref=sr_1_8?dchild=1&keywords=12v+turbo+fan&qid=1604560881&s=computers&sr=1-8) is similar in power. I personally use an old server fan which I salvaged from an old server rack, it looks [like this](https://www.tokopedia.com/friendsgaming/fg-hp-super-high-speed-bldc-fan-12v-16-5a?refined=true&whid=0).
3. 1X 220V AC to 12V DC converter:This is required to power the fan (as the fan runs on 12V). You can get a relatively inexpensive but powerful converter [here](https://www.flipkart.com/electrify-smps-battery-charger-12v-7-amp-7ah-220ah-charging-capacity-amf-panel-tubular-inverter-bike-truck-ups-car-12volt-chargers-inverter/p/itma17f272f6d8a3?pid=CAVFQED5YGMS2TWP&lid=LSTCAVFQED5YGMS2TWPS7GDFY&marketplace=FLIPKART&srno=s_1_1&otracker=search&otracker1=search&fm=SEARCH&iid=1220d96a-232e-49f7-80f2-b390cc83a852.CAVFQED5YGMS2TWP.SEARCH&ppt=sp&ppn=sp&ssid=04zawa27pfpn4ohs1604559583916&qH=247ac807511cf5ea). Alternatively, for all the tech-geeks out there, you can check your SMPS from your spare/old CPU, and if the ratings match, you can use it as well, save some bucks.
4. Wire: Preferably high amperage electrical wire to connect fan and adapter.

Step 2: Assembly:

1. Air purifier Body:

Open the HEPA filter from the box, but dont throw the box yet, we will use that our structure for our air-purifier body, like this:

[Unpack the HEPA Filter. Remove the plastic packaging, but dont throw the box yet.](https://preview.redd.it/x9s7ysrendx51.jpg?width=960&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=72944ef59ab035f10b0f4886c31f7739434c606c)

[Make an opening at the top which we will use to fit the fan and the wire later](https://preview.redd.it/eirequrendx51.jpg?width=960&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=7612124096c51a8a9720cc3c3528f2f7c2c37f53)

&#x200B;

[Make 4 more openings on the face of the box with of arbitrary size. Ensure the openings are not too wide to compromise the sturdiness of the box.](https://preview.redd.it/9rcj2urendx51.jpg?width=960&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=7db7b6ffbef97a9c9596f08dae231122d4ce8be2)

2. Mounting the fan

&#x200B;

[12 V BLDC Fan](https://preview.redd.it/hohrl1xlrdx51.jpg?width=960&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=deaeb31a60337441fa884f5c05e247cfea2b4185)

[We can't see it, but trust me it happens.](https://preview.redd.it/pgm7qvwlrdx51.jpg?width=960&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=50c18dcdd88207f609c7e9e2110f12a3b2a891e6)

3. Connecting the fan to powersupply

&#x200B;

[Quite simple honestly, connect the positive terminal to positive, and negative terminal to negative terminal on the connector. Unlikely you'll get a shock, but be careful anyway.](https://preview.redd.it/8pqm2turrdx51.jpg?width=960&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=1418c8c355053356e7aa45190e151c15233f6ece)

4. Switch on the powersupply and it should start working, depending on power of the fan it maybe be bit noisy.

&#x200B;

[Yep, its bit noisy.](https://reddit.com/link/jofmlz/video/7dobs9n9sdx51/player)

# Performance

Typically Air purifier performance is measured in CADR, But I neither had equipment nor enthusiasm to do that. This is a small experiment I ran in a closed room ((15X15 ft) with air conditioning ON & OFF, and a PM2.5 measurement device (you can buy it or build it yourself using using an arduino and [SDS011 sensor](https://robokits.co.in/sensors/laser/sds011-laser-particle-and-dust-sensor-pm2.5).

&#x200B;

[Within an hour there was significant reduction in the PM2.5 levels.](https://preview.redd.it/ro9z4d3btdx51.png?width=1648&format=png&auto=webp&s=86c0790510103ef8c881626bfa1ddcbd5b44d8bd)

# Closing Thoughts

1. My consecutive experiments with Air Purifier reveal that in an hour it usually brings down the AQI to significantly lower numbers.  But again, I'm not in Delhi, so I don't know how well it will perform in polluted conditions.
2. Instead of keeping it on throughout the day, I prefer keeping it ON for an hour per day in my closed room, typically in the evening,  go out for a walk as its noisy, and then come back.
3. The AC filters are definitely less clogged when I use air purifier. It should be having a positive effect on my lungs as well.
4. For tech savvy people, we can further use DC-DC relays, integrate it with ESP8266 and make it as an iOT device.

Again there are so many things we can build on top of this, but this basic purifier should help a little in these polluted times in our cities. Hope it helps!","This is a Fakespot Reviews Analysis bot. Fakespot detects fake reviews, fake products and unreliable sellers using AI.

Let me start with some background.

I came from BPL family , we are living in a metro city on rent since we moved here cause our village get affected by the flood.

My father started earning wages by selling fruit on a pull cart(thela).

From then to till now I never feel I can ever be respected in society because we never had money.

We live in a slum type place in Delhi where people do not respect who live on rent.

Landowners consider themselves superior.

So from childhood to now I never had the courage to feel confident.

I am 23 years old but still crippled with the same inferiority complex which I used to feel when I first went to a good school, a good college.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

I have one big regret, I wasted my college time(and my parents' hard-earned money) and now I am stuck in an MNC with a 3.5 LPA package. 

I want to change it.

I have now started working on JAVA but I am kinda overwhelmed with the number of things I want to do now.

As of now, I am learning core java , spring, servlets, hibernate, MVC as these are the project requirement in which I am.

Other than this for my personal growth, I am learning Python, statistics, Maths, and machine learning as I want to go into the ML field.

For ML, I  have shortlisted 5 books total of 4000 pages.

One course which has a duration of 500 hours of learning (Content + Assignments).

I do have project work too as I am working full time around 4 hours max in a day.

I feel I will not be able to complete all this stuff and will never come out of poverty.

I need advice on how should I go ahead with all this.

Will I able to call myself a middle-class person?","I don't have any advice, just wanna wish you the best of luck.  Keep working hard and achieve your dreams. ",2020-11-24 01:46:32

The 14th Amendment's Due Process clause extends these rights to state courts.

It’s encourages baseless litigation. Before 1950’s costs were always awarded, this meant people those who didn’t have strong claims didn’t bother going to court. India also had jury trials which meant prosecution didn’t get second chances and had to always convince “reasonable people” in a “reasonable period of time”.

It hates unmarried good-looking women even more. There is a reason why women like Draupadi, Sita and Shakuntala exist in our literature. They are warnings meant to educate you. If you're in the wrong place, you will be punished, and everyone will love to watch you burn. Misogyny is a part and parcel of Indian culture. It has always been this way and it will always be this way.
* Your biggest asset is your financial independence. This is the ONLY leverage you have and will ever have. Do NOT sacrifice your education or career for your family or children. Invest in yourself, invest in your future. Keep your finances separate from your partner. Do not trust anyone with your money. If your husband/boyfriend spends money on you, try to match it as much as you can. Do NOT accept free lunches.
* If your partner is paying for the house you live in, it is not your house. What belongs to you is only what belongs to you legally. Unless you pay the rent (and keep the receipts) or have the lease in your name, it is not your house. It doesn’t matter if you have lived in it for 6 months or 10 years. It is not your house.
* The Indian state is an extension of the Indian family. Deeply patriarchal and broken. Don’t rely on the police, media, or any kind of state apparatus. You need to know that you’re vulnerable. Only money and power can protect you. Acquire those.
* Indian society doesn’t believe in love. It believes in transactions. Indians pay billions of rupees to watch romance on-screen but for them, it exists only on screen. It is entertainment. Be careful with who you love. Do not devote yourself to men who don't deserve it. Shower your love on yourself before you give it to any man.
* What is considered fun for men, is considered debauchery for women. Indian society doesn't see women as humans who need to relax and enjoy themselves. If he smokes weed, he is stressed and needs to let loose. If you drink alcohol, you are a characterless bad influence. Remember this hypocrisy and have fun with only those who you trust. If you can afford it, travel outside India to have fun.
* Learn to think of relationships in terms of sunk costs. This is a concept in finance but it applies to life too. You don't need to stay in a bad investment just because you invested in it. Just because you gave a man 5 years in your past, you don't need to give him 5 years of your future. You can walk away anytime. Limit your losses. The past is irrelevant to the future.
* If you have to live with dignity on your own terms, you have to fight. You have to fight everyone and everything. You will be crushed often. But it is a price worth paying.

&#x200B;

EDIT: Thank you, everyone, this post seems to have struck a chord with all. By and large, the response has been positive, and it is very reassuring to me to know that there are many sensitive and empathetic Indians willing to change the toxic mindsets they have been raised with. Reddit also seems to be the last bastion relatively free of Sanghi trolls. Let’s try to keep it that way!

If I can make an appeal- PLEASE educate yourself about patriarchy. It is a system so deep-rooted and insidious that it is often hard to recognize. Familiarize yourself with the works of Indian feminists such as Kamla Bhasin. You can start with her TED talk [here.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HmmvM1NOI1s) Before I met her, I thought people were bigoted and they have to be ignored/challenged etc. But after meeting her, I realized that patriarchy is a system meant to perpetuate itself and the only way to be free of it is to recognize it within yourself and STOP living your life according to the damaging ideas we have all unconsciously imbibed.

Thank you again!","Is it just me or did media played a huge part in this tragedy. 

I'm not here to offend anyone or receive just trying to seek different perspectives.

Media (including social media) blew this whole case up rather than let it silently proceed as per law.

Gender equality, freedom of speech and financial independence are must for any citizen no matter what. It's just heart breaking that it isn't practiced.

But indulging in drugs or anything illegal should never be portrayed as cool for anyone. Today we are consuming media which is obsessed with violence, drinking and drugs etc and it extremely accessible to younger audience. Though this normalises the idea of existence of drugs in society it should be never thought of being an healthy(or cool) habit.

What we have been seeing these past few days is a character of Rhea created by the media. Rhea might as well be the culprit in Sushant's death. We can't rule out that as his own relatives asked for trial against her. But neither should we form our opinions based of sympathy or empathy from the facts which clearly we don't know about as precisely as the cbi does.

I just feel like we should carefully analyse the credibility of the media we are consuming these day and restrain if it's not credible enough.

Also regrading the women in our epics, from my perspective the epic represent all elements of the society including the evil. The pandavas went for war when Draupadi was humiliated because that's what someone should do when such things happen to someone close . Please do not just focus on the selective narrative of the whole story. Just my perspective. ",2020-09-09 01:22:54

1781,The ineffectiveness of the current reservation system demands immediate reform.,jzgroy,india,13,False,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/jzgroy/the_ineffectiveness_of_the_current_reservation/,11,Policy/Economy,"Reservation needs a thorough reform. The system in place is exploited by a small percentage of the specific community over and over. There needs to be a system to check and eliminate these 'privileged percentage' gradually so that people who are socially and economically backward can avail the quotas.

It's also intellectually ridiculous to group the well-off urban families who have access to modern education and the intended marginalized ones who suffer extreme discrimination which pulls them down from achieving social and economic uplift, together. They are not the same. The caste they share is an absurd idea that gets dissolved when they achieve *independence* and thus they are indeed unfit for reservation.

When I commented the first passage on a thread before, one of the comments I got really interested me. They were supporting the current system arguing this is the only way the system works and it should be kept the same way. I will link the comments if anybody is interested, but when I questioned that stance, they immediately accused me of being higher caste and being unaware of the struggles people from poor communities face. This was very interesting to me as this person doesn't know anything about me, and on a post advocating a reform of the reservation system to help the struggling, they are accusing me of being an upper-caste moron.

This reminded me of something that happened in my college days. Our insti had a rebellious political student body who were famous throughout the country. I worked with them a lot more than I should have and I have tried every possible way to have a discussion on the i*neffectiveness of the current system* before failing in exhaustion. Mind you, they conduct talks and seminars every weekend and are powerful enough to cause some nationwide ripples. It took me time to understand the interest of the leaders were not what I thought. I started to notice the ones giving the ted model talks on lower-caste uplifting and shouting Dalit power slogans in front of the cameras and I didn't find them familiar at all. It was a scary experience realizing they are not advocating for the struggling, they are advocating for them.

Why's this happening everywhere; well the answer is easy. A big portion of reservation activists does not care about the marginalized percentage whose rights keep getting stolen. But why; Simple. They are not the saviors, they are the thieves. The one's who supposedly speaking for the communities are the ones hurting them, stealing their reservations, and keeping them in the dark.

This idea isn't something new or radical. I would assume most of us are aware of this but the one who is supposed to speak for the communities are the ones who take advantage of their misery and thus the game continues unchanged. This has to stop.","> I would assume most of us are aware of this 

This is possibly knowledge bias. Not a good idea to assume everybody has the same knowledge. Especially in a social environment where many people deny existence of caste discrimination altogether. And many other people use bad faith techniques like impersonating identities to state their agendas. 

If you want to convince people - at least the open-minded good-intentioned egalitarian ones - it can't be done through reddit posts, broad claims (""reservations are ineffective"", ""stealing reservations""), anecdotes, conspiracy theories about activists, and hand waving over what those reforms should be. 

There are anecdotes of some oppressed caste persons benefiting greatly but there are also anecdotes of well-off oppressed caste persons being systemically discriminated in colleges and jobs too. So, any analysis should step back from anecdotes and look at statistical data and perhaps simulations like the ones computational sociologists do. The anecdotes can inform what data should be collected and what factors should be experimented with, but anecdotes by themselves cannot be used to justify radical changes in policies that may adversely affect as many as 75% (1 billion) of India's population who fall in SC/ST/OBC categories.

Instead, you'll have to come up with rigorous data, properly-defined metrics and actionable suggestions, possibly done in collaboration with like-minded social science experts. And then market its results to society as a book or academic report or published articles or TED talks. ",2020-11-23 20:32:41

### Tl;dr

Today i.e. 26 November 2020, the Jammu & Kashmir Government is expected to issue another order under the Temporary Telecom Suspension Rules 2017 either extending or modifying internet restrictions in the region which have already crossed 480 days. After successive rounds of litigation before the Supreme Court, 4G mobile internet access was restored in 2 out of 20 districts of Jammu & Kashmir on 16 August 2020 but there has been no further relaxation of restrictions since then. Meanwhile, non-publication of orders issued by the Review Committee and the Special Committee remains a problem in Jammu & Kashmir which must be decided by the Supreme Court to ensure independent application of mind by these bodies and implementation of their recommendations.

### Background

Today, the Jammu & Kashmir Government is expected to issue another order under the Temporary Telecom Suspension Rules 2017 either extending or modifying the internet restrictions imposed in the region. All communication services were first snapped on 05 August 2019, and so far, 4G mobile internet access has only been restored in 2 districts of Jammu & Kashmir, which are Ganderbal and Udhampur. In the remaining 18 districts, mobile internet speed is still being slowed down to 2G which is insufficient to support most modern websites and applications.  Due to slow internet speed, the residents of Jammu & Kashmir have been unable to access online education, telemedicine and work from home facilities during the COVID-19 pandemic.

The internet restrictions in Jammu & Kashmir have been the subject of successive rounds of litigation, with the most recent being the contempt petition and application for directions filed by the Foundation for Media Professionals (FMP) earlier this year. On 11 May 2020, the Supreme Court had [**constituted**](https://internetfreedom.in/supreme-courts-j-k-4g-restoration-decision-disappointing-but-we-are-determined/) a Special Committee comprising (i) Secretary, Ministry of Home Affairs,  (ii) Secretary, Department of Telecommunications, and (iii) Chief Secretary, Government of Jammu & Kashmir to immediately review the 4G mobile internet ban. Since there was no information available in the public domain about the functioning of the Special Committee, FMP was constrained to [**file**](https://internetfreedom.in/fmp-contempt-petition-reply/) a contempt petition before the Supreme Court again on 09 June 2020.

During the course of hearings in the contempt petition, the government revealed that the Special Committee had held two meetings since its constitution on 15 May 2020 and 10 June 2020, and it had decided to defer the issue for two months since the security situation was allegedly not conducive to relaxation of internet restrictions. On 11 August 2020, the government stated that the Special Committee held its third meeting on 10 August 2020 where it found that the threat perception in Jammu & Kashmir continues to be high and that internet speed restrictions did not have any impact on COVID-19 control measures, education or business. However, the Special Committee [**agreed**](https://internetfreedom.in/staggered-4g-restoration-j-k/) that 4G mobile internet can be restored in select low risk areas. This recommendation was put into effect by the Jammu & Kashmir Government on 16 August 2020 when it restored 4G mobile internet access in one district of Kashmir and one district of Jammu each.

### Pending Supreme Court judgement

The contempt petition filed by FMP was disposed off by the Supreme Court on 11 August 2020 after the Union Government provided information about the meetings of the Special Committee and agreed to staggered 4G restoration in low risk areas. However, the application for directions filed by FMP was kept pending since it highlighted unresolved problems about non-publication of orders issued by the Review Committee and the Special Committee and lack of periodic review.

In its written reply filed on 25 August 2020, the Union Government has claimed that there exists no legal obligation to publish orders issued by the Review Committee and the Special Committee, and publication is necessary only for orders issued by the Home Secretary. In its rejoinder submissions, FMP has asserted that an obligation to publish orders issued by the Review Committee and the Special Committee flows from Articles 14, 19 and 21 of the Constitution. The rejoinder submissions were filed by FMP on 13 October 2020 and we are still awaiting the judgement of the Supreme Court on the issue of publication of orders issued by the Review Committee and the Special Committee.

In the meanwhile, the Special Committee was also supposed to examine the outcome of trial restoration of 4G mobile internet access in Ganderbal and Udhampur after two months as per the additional affidavit filed by the Union Government. Since 4G mobile internet was restored in these districts on 16 August 2020, the Special Committee should have held another meeting on or before 16 October 2020 but no information is available in the public domain about when such a meeting was held and whether any further relaxation of internet restrictions was recommended. The orders issued by the Home Secretary of Jammu & Kashmir Government on 21 October 2020 and 12 November 2020 reference a meeting of the Special Committee but they don't provide more specific information.

### Why is publication of review orders necessary?

**(i) Implementation**

The process of review by the Review Committee and the Special Committee is intended to serve as a robust procedural safeguard against arbitrary and disproportionate use of internet shutdowns. However, without disclosure of the recommendations issued by the Review Committee and the Special Committee, it is impossible for the general public to obtain any information about the outcome of these review processes and whether their recommendations are actually being implemented.

Concerns exist about implementation of the recommendations of the Review Committee and the Special Committee because these bodies performs an advisory role and its findings are not binding in nature. Publication of recommendations of the Review Committee and the Special Committee is the only way to determine if their findings are being implemented, and such bare minimum transparency is necessary to enable aggrieved individuals to seek judicial remedy if their findings are being disregarded. The existence of two separate committees entrusted with the same function of reviewing internet restrictions in Jammu & Kashmir makes disclosure of recommendations even more important because otherwise, it is impossible for the public to know whether the findings of the two committees were consistent with each other and what were the reasons for disagreement, if any.

**(ii) Independent application of mind**

The Union Government has claimed that publication of orders of the Review Committee is not necessary since it is not a *“new statutory order or directions”* under the Temporary Telecom Suspension Rules 2017. However, the order issued by the Review Committee cannot be considered a mere extension of the order issued by the Home Secretary since such an interpretation would negate the Review Committee’s role as an oversight body which is expected to independently apply its mind to the facts underlying suspension orders.

Under Rule 2(6) of the Temporary Telecom Suspension Rules 2017, the Review Committee is required to determine if the prevailing situation in an area satisfies the requirements of Section 5(2) of the Telegraph Act, which can be invoked only on the occurrence of a public emergency or in the interest of public safety. In order to arrive at this determination, the Review Committee presumably evaluates all relevant material including but not limited to district wise figures of terrorism related incidents, latest information about the impact of internet restrictions and any changes in threat levels between the issuance of the suspension order and the date of review.

The examination of such material by the Review Committee is essential since the Supreme Court has unequivocally held that the geographical and temporal scope of internet restrictions must be narrowly tailored to what is absolutely necessary to combat an emergent situation. Therefore, if the Review Committee is functioning in accordance with the letter and spirit of the Supreme Court's directions, its orders will provide additional facts and reasoning, and they cannot be considered a mere repetition of the contents of the suspension order issued by the Home Secretary.

Since today's Karnataka bandh and r/bangalore is going to be a hot spot, I thought of staying at home till evening. So, I bought 4 litres of milk to make homemade Paneer and do some tasty dish.

I cut open the pack with great zest, poured the ice cold milk to the big Milk saucepan, set the flame to high, waited patiently for it to come close to a rolling boil, squeezed the lemon to separate the Whey and milk curds, and voila, I had, in front of me, dancing curds of smoking hot Paneer.

Following the procedure, I strained the Whey and placed the searing Paneer on the Muslin cloth and started to dip in icy water to remove the sourness. I then rolled the cloth, placed a heavy object on it to bring it to a proper shape, and kept it aside and went to take a bath.

Now the Pique:

My grandfather enters the scene, he eats his breakfast, makes himself a cup of coffee, finishes it, and then decides to wash his plate and cup. After doing that, his eyes catches a cloth being rolled and wrapped and being pushed down by a heavy utensil. Curious mind of his starts to investigate and he finds something white, grainy textured, a tad hot 'thing'.

He thought that 'accidentally' someone had placed it there. So, being the gentleman, loving, caring, and helping Grandfather/Father-in-law/Father/ he collects the 'waste' and neatly empties every grain, ounce of it to the drain. I never thought I'd say this, but my efforts literally went down the drain! 

When I found out I was angry and sad. When I asked him, he had this huge smile and a sense of achievement, as, according to him, he had helped. Looking at that, my only thought was the realisation of his actions which were nothing but innocence and having the good sense of helping.

I told him what that 'waste' was, he regretted it badly and apologized profusely. I told him I'll get Paneer from the store and would make him a wonderful dish, his eyes gleamed with happiness and told that he'd assist in cooking.

My day is already made, thanks to my grandfather's inadvertent, innocent actions.","My granddad passed away a month and a half ago, and now this made me miss him so terribly :( please cherish him, he's a gem! ",2020-12-05 13:02:13

I'm ok with him being in my house for a short time before you find a place but dude he doesn't think he'll ever find a pg. He even said that I expect you to help me with my travel expenses for everyday and my food. Of course he forgot the shelter. I'm like dude why are you working then? 
I'm ok to support if you're in dire need. But not these entitled idiots.


###
Case 2:

My another aunt wanted me to take care of their house relocation and when I did whatever they asked me to. Like getting the house cleaned, getting a transport company and taking care of some of their relatives you'd expect them to thank you. But no fck you because we're entiled we want you to leave your day job and take care of stuff. Get angry on me and complain about my perfection. I loved and respected my aunt since my childhood but it was all gone in a few minutes.
I grew up poor not dirt poor but poor enough. Today I make a decent living. When my father died at age of 10 and when we were poor nobody was there for us. We survived on rationed rice. Nobody asked what we ate. 
When my mother and wife were hospitalised these people who’re expecting me to help weren’t there.
Now that I have some money and moved into a decent house they want my help. It's cute when these people talk about realtions and family. 
These relatives looked down upon us because of our status. Now f*ck you before you expect something from at least be reasonable.
Now I don't believe in relatives anymore. You learn your leasons.

###
Case 3:

My wife’s sister stayed with us during the entire lockdown and did I mention her friend too? We were like that’s ok because we’re not able to feed the migrants lets at least feed these girls who are by the way working. No problem with it at all. But this lady my wife’s sister goes back to her hometown and tells that I’m an idiot. She says I asked her to give my personal laptop when she was wait for it watching movies with her friend. 

There are just a couple of relatives who were there for me when I needed them and I’ll be indebted to them.


Thank you for the rest of the relatives. But I don’t need you anymore.

###
Edit:

I knew this was relatable for every family but didn’t think it was so common. 
I think keeping these relations transactional is the best. You help me I help you. 
It would be unfair if I don’t mention that my relatives helped me with money when my mother was hospitalised. But it was because she took care of my grandmother while none of her children cared about her. But it was a nominal amount and I didn’t ask them for it. I didn’t have insurance back then so this situation happened. It was purely transactional. In person support is way more valuable than money.

###

UPDATE

So this cousin from case 1 just got ego hurt when I told him it was wrong of him to ask me money for travel when he's making 20k a month and I told him that it's risky for my senior citizen mother to live in the space when he's using public transport and should find a space after intial few days.
Now he went to some other cousin's place and my aunt has called my mother complaining about how we have behaved with him.🤦‍♂️
Thank you for all the awards. After all there’s some people here at least who care.",incest go brrr ,2020-11-25 22:08:22
1822,Update on events at Jadavpur University so far today,d6huzu,india,162,False,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/d6huzu/update_on_events_at_jadavpur_university_so_far/,36,Unverified," Update on events at JU so far today (as gathered via those on the ground who are not in a space to be able to do this):

ABVP-BJP-RSS have broken Gate 4, and set it on fire along with the board that has the university's name and logo on it and other notice boards. The gates were closed to prevent them from coming in and they broke through. They were carrying trishuls, rods, tubelights, firearms etc. A loaded chamber was found lying on the ground, which, they claimed happened because the safety lock wasn't on. Anyone could have been shot today because they were careless. They've broken and set fire to the union room and all the furniture in it and thrown ACID BULBS inside campus. Tarit-da's stationery shop has also been hit badly. Hara-da's shop as well. They have both managed to escape relatively unscathed, as has Bhoothnath-da, from what I hear.

Babul Supriyo and his goons hit students earlier today. One is hospitalised, countless injured. The student body demanded that wouldn't be allowed to leave until he apologises. He refused to do anything of the sort and his party's goons have been breaking our campus by vandalising every building and department they can lay their hands on, trapping students within them and cutting off the power supply and effectively restricting access to the campus to relief services like the medical and fire safety department.

NOTE: There was NO gherao at any point today.

There was a human chain barricade which the Governor was allowed to walk through as he went in and ""rescued"" Babul Supriyo. When the VC went in earlier to speak to Babul Supriyo and escort him out safely he was rebuked and insulted by Babul Supriyo and eventually fell in the crowd and got injured. He has been hospitalised.

Babul Supriyo refused to move, to apologise to the students for the entire time. Instead he has constantly provocated students by shouting about ""democratic ideals"", the NRC (??!), obscenities and slut shaming female students for the length of their shirts while his guards and ABVP's goons have mercilessly beaten up students indiscriminately with their sticks, bricks and whatnot.

Our campus is in flames. And for no fault of our own. We don't have news on everyone and whatever we do have is coming out in fits and starts via whatsapp and facebook. Someone from CL PG 1 has been seriously injured by a brick that was thrown at him. There's a video going around of him giving an interview (even before any medical attention could reach him), to one of the channels of the Times network detailing who did what to him, dropping the names of BJP and ABVP. You will probably not see this on your TV screens.

The news being broadcast on national media has already has already started twisting and turning these truths to demonise the students (buzzwords like ""pro-Naxal students supporting azadi in Kashmir"" / ""Maoist aka Fascist"" are already being thrown around on Twitter by right-wing ideologues) and make victims out of Honourable MP Babul Supriyo and his men.

This propaganda machine is already in force. Just heard that female student who went to get money out of an ATM at 8B and was cornered by a mob of women who took away her phone etc. and made her apologise on video about the day's proceedings.

Why indeed was a member of parliament packing such heat and accompanied by such a large contingent of such violent manpower if he was originally there for innocent reasons?

The students of Jadavpur (and this was an open body of students from all streams, departments, batches, not all of whom were necessarily card-carrying members of the political parties on campus) have done nothing but engage in peaceful sloganeering and protest.

Many other students are still trapped in the carnage that is still going on in campus right now, without electricity or any respite. There are all kinds of rumors flying around about who or what the next wave of attacks is going to comprise of.


None of this will be forgotten.

Edit: Imgur was not working properly. So I had to use an alternative. I hope it's allowed. Here are [the pictures](https://postimg.cc/gallery/2ooid3qu2/f0c6dc74/).

Edit Edit: I have found an India Today coverage that shows the students' side of the issue. Here's the [video](https://streamable.com/skhtz) of it. And there is [footage](https://streamable.com/1av9p) of this injured guy being interviewed by all the big media houses, yet it didn't appear on the television.

1824,'Swadeshi' products are lazy and made just for a quick buck,k70dkk,india,262,False,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/k70dkk/swadeshi_products_are_lazy_and_made_just_for_a/,75,AskIndia,"Amongst the 'boycott china' craze (because we bocott anything we don't like), there is a trend of startups literally stealing the interface, design and **name** of popular foreign services. An example is tooter - twitter ripoff and FAU-G = PUB-G ripoff

People are rejoicing for these shitty low effort apps while others think its outright theft of intellectual property. What are your thoughts?

&#x200B;

EDIT: Though this is a bit off topic, i feel it's still related and therefore felt the need to add it.

Foreign work phobia-

In India, at every step, from school to at the house, you are told that if you go work for another country you are a deshrohi, that if you dont pay taxes to the government to help them fund their next MLA bribe, you are worthless.

I'm speaking for experience here, in my Hindi classes, we would have essays giving galiya (insults) to people who don't work in India where you cant breathe the air without reducing your lifespan by 20 years. 

This does 2 bad things:

1) The quality of life of people is shit and talented people aren't motivated or don't feel the need to innovate because of the aforementioned reasons.

**2) THE MAIN REASON:** Talented people, namely in the field of web development don't find employment in India and work freelance, which doesn't help with the next unicorn startup. Even if they work with a startup, their talents are undervalued. They are underpaid as fuck (13$ a month for building actual ready to release apps). People dont invest in the web development circle as it's very expensive compared to shitty INR.

All these culminate in the lives of Indian talents going to shit. People like Sundar Pichai and Satyela Nadir would be working a shit 30 thousand rupees a month job if they didn't move out of India. These people are brought up as proof of work life in India being okay, but it proves the contrary.","Umm yeah...

Before innovation comes a country copies stuff.

Look at china they used to copy almost anything and everything from manufacturing to branding to applications now they have a great production capacity ,research quality and innovation.

I don't see copying as a problem if this can further nurture industry to grow towards innovating. ",2020-12-05 11:43:26

I’m 18 year old, my dad is talking about divorcing my mother as my mother had enough of the constant pressure to be a “good” housewife and support his parents and his relatives whenever possible.

He constantly tortures her mentally and he says I didn’t tell you to do all this for me but whenever she tries to go against his point he’ll start talking that I never liked you please leave me why did you stay with me for all these 20 years even though I torture you. Now he’s telling that he’ll give us the house we are living in and half his salary and other half to his parents. Also whenever there is arguments he’ll break his phone and then blame her for wasting his money and forcing him to break it. I’m under a suspicion he’s hiding something. We have another property under construction under my moms name and he’s telling that I’ll not take its liability. He used to have a affair with someone from office and he fought with us often about it. He also gave her some huge amount of cash and told us he’s keeping contact so that she will help us in future. But she scammed him and took all the money and my mom had to support him in front of everyone. 
I don’t think I, my brother and my mom can live with 50% salary and pay the remaining half of the new property.
Also my mom doesn’t want the divorce she wants him to understand her feeling. But dad straight out said he won’t understand anything and please leave. Now my mom is threatening him that I’ll kill my self if you destroy my image like this in the society. But my dad has no sympathy and he just wants this to get over. I believe he’s a narcissist.

* Amortized Principal (1/12) BB Daily : Rs. XYZ
* Amortized Interest (1/12) BB Daily : Rs. ABC
* GST on Amortized Interest : Rs. PQR

These amounts did not match any payment I had made on those dates on BB Daily. Upon following this up with the CC company they told me that BB Daily had converted one of my recent lump-sum payments into EMI payments, **with a 13% effective rate of interest!** 

I had made no request for such a conversion while making this payment on BB Daily. I got no warning that this change was being made: all the communication (OTP SMS, SMS confirmation, and email confirmation) that I got from the CC company on the date of payment mentioned the lump-sum amount, and nothing about conversion to EMIs.

The CC customer care executive insisted that the merchant had converted my lump-sum payment to EMI mode. I had no idea that the merchant could do this **without our consent**, especially since it costs me money in terms of interest at 13%. 

Apparently **we can only reverse this** to normal (non-EMI) payment mode, **free of charge, within 10 days of the payment date**. After this we can foreclose the EMIs, but that will cost some extra money. So you will end up paying extra just like that!

When I called up BB Daily they denied any knowledge of such a conversion from their part. I am not sure whom to trust here, but it would be prudent to keep an eye on your CC transactions off and on, and not wait till the monthly statement arrives: by then it may be too late to reverse the EMI to normal mode free of charge.",What is BB Daily? ,2020-11-10 19:25:02

Classifying all Muslims as terrorists and all Hindus as Modi supporters isn't fair and shouldn't be done, I mean, why should we? As a Muslim, I can clearly say Islam is perfect for me but Muslims aren't. The same could be said by any follower of any religion. People just randomly hate a community just because a few outliers did something wrong in the name of the community but they don't represent the entire community and that's a fact. they may say they do represent but trust me they don't.

Hon'ble Shri. Narendra Modi Ji,       Prime Minister of India - New Delhi
    
Subject : Declaring Kerala as Union Territory

Respected Sir,

Kerala State Population in 2020 is Estimated to the tune of 36 Million (3.6 Crores) according to Unified Identification Aadhar India .. It is the 23rd Largest State in India, by Area of 38863 Sq. Kms. ..!!

Hindu Population has come down nosediving to less than 50%; in the last three Decades. The rate of financially rich in Kerala is Highest among Muslims at 25%; followed by Christians at 20%; and Hindus at 8%; which is very much alarming to Hindus in the State ..!!

The fastest growing religion is Muslim, at 25%: followed by Christians at 20%; and Hindus at 3%; as of now .. In the near future, Kerala State will be dominated by Muslims. At the present they are demanding to declare as Muslim State, which will follow 'Shariyat Law' in the State .. Most of the Muslim Population have Migrated ILLEGALLY, from Bangala Desh and Myanmar (Rohingya Muslims ..!!)

Most of the Urban Naxalites and Terrorists are from Kerala, supported by Popular Front of India (PFI ) funded by Muslim Countries ..!!

Many times, Hindu Temples/Ashrams are not only threatened, but also robbed by Muslims and Donations given by Hindu Devotees are snatched away ..!!There are many Incidents of demolition and disfiguration of Temples and Hindu Civilization ..!!

Incidences of Love Jihad and rapes on Hindu girls on mass levels are seen in Kerala State, however, Govt. of Kerala, either Left or Congress, do not take any cognizance nor protect the Rights of Hindus ..!! Even in case of education, it is FREE for Muslims, and Hindus have to pay donations to educational Institutions for admission of their Children .. Legislative Assembly Constituencies in Kerala, are 140 ..!! Out of which, 50 MLAs are Muslims. In short, Kerala State is dominated by Muslims, in all respects ..!!

It is our humble submission to the Hon. Prime Minister to bring a Bill in the Parliament, to declare Kerala State as Union Territory so that, many Issues can be resolved..!! Of course, there will be lot of opposition by other Parties in the Country ..!!

Thanking You;

Yours Sincerely

Guys, I have now launched a 2nd MVP for my startup, implementing all of the feedback i got from my 1st one.

First of all i would like to thank all of you for the honest and constructive feedback on my1st MVP, which i posted 3 weeks ago.

My startup is based on providing detailed University analysis and also a forum to ask questions and find answers for students who are looking to study abroad. The forum has reputation points, badges and all of those things and strong moderation as well.

The core mission of this startup is to create an informed and resilient student community where we can help each other in getting all of our doubts cleared and make sure that we get the maximum out of our study abroad adventure

It would be great to have your feedback, so that i could make it much better. The link to the MVP is [https://uniselector.com/](https://uniselector.com/)","There are a few inconsistencies in the websites.

Most of the things that are clickable have no indication to be clicked. 
The text is too small to read on the phone and in my opinion phone views will be much more than browser.
The text and layout is very weird and makes the site look kinda suspicious cause there's a lot of fakes out there trying to make money off of students especially.
The website has a very generic bootstrap template which isn't very assuring.
I'd highly suggest hiring a developer and a UI/UX guy to help you out cause that is what this needs more than anything.

Currently, his newest video exposes a call center scam and he's seen patrolling around it with a friend. He says that the owner is a really rich person with many connections (because he saw the call centers security team) and most likely has a connection with the police.

1888,So many consultancies are trying to dupe students/freshers looking for jobs. This is what happened to me.,c84t0z,india,307,False,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/c84t0z/so_many_consultancies_are_trying_to_dupe/,65,[R]eddiquette,"I am looking for a job while currently pursuing my masters. Since i graduated in economics with no technical skills in hand, the majority of jobs being offered to me are crappy BPO and backend ones. 

Me and my friend who's in the same boat decided to apply on job portals and we start getting all sorts of calls hiring for voice/non voice process. Some of them were bonafide but i think, majority of them were from fraud consultancies. I got an offer for an interview in Delhi's Badarpur and accepted to come for the interview. The day before, i was wondering that nothing good has ever happened in Badarpur and did a quick google search only to find a consumer complaint filed against the 'consultancy' that i was going to. 

A few days later, me and my friend got another offer for an interview in two consultancies that were in very close proximity to each other. We, being the idiots we are, forget to double check and went to the agencies the next day. I, although asked everything about any hidden charges and ofcourse she lied.


The one i went to made me wait for about half an hour for the interview, i have given interviews before and knew this is not how it works. *Mujhe pata chal gaya tha mera chutiya kat chuka hai.* The interviewer was hardly 10th pass who was struggling to ask questions in English and the moment she uttered i can offer you 35k, i knew this is a scam and she's about to ask me for money which she did. There's no way i can get 35k even if i sold my body to a pimp. So i stormed out of there and called my friend.


What happened with him is more interesting, when they asked him for money, he got himself out by saying he need some time to think. He went down to smoke and he saw three police officers marching towards the building. The moment they saw my friend they asked ""how much were they asking?"". My friend replied 10k but he gave them nothing. He showed them the way inside the building.


So my friend was sitting outside the room where the interviews took place watching the entire raid taking place. A BTech graduate who paid 2k rupees as 'security' to the the frauds comes after giving a ""telephonic interview"" and says to my friend *bhut tough interview tha, aadhe ghante grill kia*. The police officer shouted from inside *koi interview nahi tha, iska pati hai vo*. This poor delusional guy was still under the impression that he'll get the job untill everything was explained to him.  He gave the lady 2k rupees which the police got back from her.



Any adequately informed job seeker who has given at least one interview knows that only frauds asks money from candidates but i guess there are still people who in desperation, will oblige and pay.

I also feel like an idiot for not cross checking this time and believing everything she told me over the phone like no hidden charges etc.


This all happened 2 days ago and i have another interview lined up later today for a fairly good profile (no BPO/backend crap) after clearing an online test for it. It's the real deal and it'll give an okay start to a fresher like me.

That said, i still feel like an idiot that i went there and waited 30 minutes only to get conned.","Ha! Literally went through the same stuff, you did man. Got called for such 'interviews' atleast thrice and and by the end they were asking for 7500, 1500, whatever. At one time, the girl taking the interview kept decreasing the price until she said 'dont you even have 200 ruppees?' 

That felt so hilarious.

On the bright side, I did manage to get a BPO job yesterday through one these consultancies.

Few tips to know if you are looking for jobs through online portals/consultancies:

1. The consultant should be expected to check your english right there on the phone. If they don't, they are fake.
2. They should arrange your interview directly with the company. The original consultancies have an arrangement with companies where the companies themselves pay money to consultants to get them new meat for work.
3. Always check for the company name they tell you they are hiring for and there consultancy name. Check their online reviews. ",2019-07-02 12:32:17

The most memorable scene for me was a night after the Godhra massacre. I am a hindu brahmin by birth although I never believed in god or religion. 

That fated night everyone in our housing society came out at 11 pm with kitchen knives, sutli bombs and hockey sticks. Jai Sree Ram was being chanted on car speakers with the doors and boot opened (no portable speakers back then). The cause? A rumor spread by someone about an incoming mob of muslims. 

The entire locality, which now houses the Marriott hotel at less than 100m away, came out with knives, was out with dangerous crackers, sticks and a lot of enthusiasm to kill. Uncles I considered to be gentle folks were wearing tikkis and holding trishuls. 

That muslim mob never came, possibly it was fake news. 

But I realized how people can transform at the drop of a hat when confronted with religion. 

My friends in primary school said that muslims are bad, in the presence of muslim teachers. I never knew what a muslim was, but they did. 

Soon, the shops of muslims were looted on CG road. That was the most shopping destination of Ahmedabad. 

My teachers saw how a stabbed guy was running to his death in the old city (my school was in St Xaviers mirzapur). People used Ether on knives to mask the injury. They stabbed you in the crowd, and you won't feel the pain till it was too late.

What is happening now is eerily similar.
Bastard chutias with 0 contribution to elections or society are making Delhi into Gujarat. Same principles. Target muslims. Expect retaliation. Employ hindu khatre mein hain rhetoric. 

Please do not react Muslims. Delhi is not Gujarat. Even the kattar gandu bhakts will piss in their pants before shooting at you with cameras everywhere. Use cameras. Use alarms to know if any bhakt is doing mischief in your vicinity. They do all this to cause riots. 

DO NOT BECOME THEIR FODDER. 
TRUST ME, BETTER DAYS COME. SUCH BHAJPA CHUTIAS WILL BE PUNISHED.

THEY WILL NOT TOLERATE SHIT LIKE MORON GUJARATIS WHO DON'T GET MINIMUM WAGE AS LABOURERS, GUARDS AND EVEN TEACHERS, BUT STILL SUPPORT MODI.","I always used to believe that it's the outsiders who spread violence.

I was working with Pankti Mehta from Forbes India on an [article](https://www.forbesindia.com/article/take-one-big-story-of-the-day/whitehat-jr-and-the-curious-case-of-disappearing-dissent/63627/1). 

*Forbes India* reached out to both WhiteHat Jr as well as YouTube India with detailed questionnaires on Wednesday (October 21) around 3.30 pm 

I received three emails from YouTube Copyright between 5.59 pm and 6.28 pm. 

Each of the emails now said, “The complaint lacks one or more legally-required elements of a copyright takedown notice, so we asked the requesting party to provide additional information to complete their notice. Pending their response to our email, we reinstated your video(s) and resolved your copyright strike”.

&#x200B;

Points to be noted: 

1. All of my appeals had been ALREADY rejected by YouTube stating "" it's unclear to us whether you have a valid reason for filing a counter-notification, so we won't be able to honor your request"".
2. Youtube reinstated 14 videos within a 30 min time span, from TWO diff YouTube channels. AND the reason they gave was that they didn't get a reply from the complaint. But all the videos were removed on different days, how come the deadline of reply from complaint all the 14 videos was right on eve of 21st Oct.
3. My Videos from the third channel arnt taken down by Byjus/Aiplex/WhiteHatJr since [Ken Article](https://the-ken.com/story/byjus-silencing-of-online-dissent/) got published (6th Oct). And the same videos are taken down from other channels (there are people who help me by uploading the same videos on diff channels).
4. Video of the kid mentioned in the Forbes article, Jihan Haria, is banned on his channel, and its WORKING on my channel! Why?

Enough of their bullying, I won't hesitate now in saying what's obvious. Someone in the YouTube India office is corrupt and eating Byjus biscuits. For a month I was tagging YouTubeIndia over twitter and NOT ONCE they replied to my tweets, whereas they usually reply to others such complaints. 

This issue is not now just about the WhiteHatJr scam, but it's getting deeper, on how a couple of corporates are dictating freedom of speech over the internet. We have enough proof showing how Byjus control Quora. Recently when I posted about WhiteHatJr female director harassing me with false allegations, that article was also taken down from LinkedIn. This dictatorship needs to stop. And time has come to straighten them out. 

ALL VIDEOS which WhiteHatJr and Byjus have taken down by now must be unbanned. Every single video, along with apologies from Karan Bajaj ('certified' from Discovery and 'Google'). Admins I want to create a post with a list of all such videos, which I will keep on curating and updating until we make Byjus unban every single such video. Guys, if you know such people/videos please do send me the link.

I ordered a simple combo from Desi Sawad restaurant on Zomato past 12pm at night. I found out in track my order option in Zomato that this place is walkable distance from my home. I was curious as to not seeing any board for new opening. Upon calling the restaurant. I find out that its disguised under the name Al-Khansah. 

Upon asking the manager he told me that they have only 1 kitchen but 3 restaurants registered in zomato for the same place. So no matter what you order it will be taste and look the same as its cooked from the same kitchen. Remaining 2 exist only online.

I entered the shop by bowing down under the quaterly opened shutter of the restaurant. And oh dear, you cannot believe how  the food that we recieve in our package is cooked.

All the workers were in their vest/banyan. They were rubbing chest hairs and picking noses while cooking chapatis. And there were cockroaches and insects on every piece of wall, utensils, slabs(where dough is prepared). They were sweating all over and dripping their sweat while flattening rotis.

Any human being is guaranteed to get sick and severely ill after eating there.


Now this begs the questions. 

**How can places like this have health and hygiene standards approval passed to open restaurants?  
Do they have the permit to open at night after 12?  
Is it okay to receive exactly same type of food from 3 different entities and yet 1 physical kitchen?  
Is zomato doing any sort of background check at all for kitchen quality and  validate if its new restaurant?  
What can I do as a citizen to complaint against such practices?**

Note: Al-Khansah is not alone. Many restaurants do this.
Rangla Punjab(Bellandur) reception have 12+ phones on desk to receive orders. They have multiple restaurants under the names like Punjabi dawat and punjabi zone as well. Ofcourse all registered for single physical entity/kitchen. And dont even start about their kitchen.

Lahore back then had a lot of progressive Islamic thinkers who struggled with trying to bring about a new modernism while still maintaining their faith. Syed Ahmed Khan had several fatwas put against him for his radical ideas of having young Muslims enter then modern society. Allama Iqbal, who is now considered a founding father of what is modern Pakistan, wrote extensively in his poetry and his critiques about this schism between his humanistic values and his love for what he saw as Islamic humanistic values, and his problems with the backwardness of Islamic society and the values it laid on things - Taking Issue, Allah's Answer and A Reconstruction of Religious Thought in Islam.

There is definitely that feeling of progressiveness in a lot of empathetic people who feel hindered by their religion but are also raised with a deep respect and love for their faith and are critical of those with hidebound and farcical views, yet they cannot set aside their religion even though they might feel adrift from the vast sea of people who feel completely different.

The march was against the issue of the Citizenship Amendment Bill and was supposed to be a peaceful protest. The Police already got the news and blocked the route by barricades in the morning. By 3:00 PM when the number of protesters becamee uncontrollable they started ""lathicharging"" and called for backup. The protesters kept on pushing forward and then were succumed to another stream of ""lathicharge"" and tear gas bomb by the police now in full gear. The protesters and police kept going back and forth in which stone pellets were exchanged from both sides leading to numerous injuries. The police even fired tear gas bombs inside the campus where end semester exams were going on. The protest continued next day inside the campus.

Today, 15th December 2019 the civilians of Okhla joined the students of Jamia Millia Islamia in the protest and finally marched forward towards the Parliament. The march was shortlived as it was a strategy by Delhi Police to sandwich the protesters from both sides and began assaulting them. Not even women and children were spared as they were in the way. The students rushed back in the campus where the police barged in and started assaulting and tear gasing the whole place. They broke in the library and washrooms and where non-protesters were also not spared. They even barged in the college mosques and teared down the place. No staff , student, male or female was spared.

1) Firstly, how is the car?- Test drive tells so little about the sustainability. New WagonR looks funny to be honest even with the pleasant inflated space, but is one of the most successful and durable models of Maruti. My second contender is Celario but many people suggested to go for WagonR only. 


2) Is company fitted CNG okay when car is not used daily?- Our running is weekend to weekend only (not going to be used for daily commute). However, rising petrol costs makes me incline towards company-fitted CNG. Also, since CNG is available in only LXi versions, I am thinking to get it upgraded with ZXi features (power windows, touchscreen music player, etc) from a trusted local garage for about Rs. 45000. 


3) Any advice on this deal?- I am getting the CNG deal for 5.9L from a local showroom, and 6.1L from authorised Maruti dealer(discounted price). I also saw the ZXi  (top model) available in petrol only that amounts to Rs.6.4L. What is your advice on the deal?


4) Lastly, should I wait until Dec end to get a better deal? I have read that companies give good discounts to meet year-end targets. 


Exisiting car users, your experience and suggestions are welcome :) Thank you for reading thus far!","Hey, everyone is rooting here for Tata products because they prioritize safety over anything which is very good and it should be the norm not exception but not a single car is perfect and we all have our different requirements from it so we should take home which fits perfectly to those requirements.

Lets try to get a practical solution for you instead of outrightly rejecting a product

1. It seems like you are a frugal person(nothing bad in it) as going for the CNG so first thing first you should go for company fitted CNG.

2. Purchasing a car is easy but maintaining it, is difficult and After sale service plays an important role here. No matter how safe car they are making they have not upgraded their ASS and most of the dealerships are crap. And it's a really big 'no'' for me because dealerships and service centres can make your life hell even for a smallest issue like fixing the AC.
Im not saying they all are like this but most of them are so choosing a good one is a task.  Quality of ASS varies from dealerships to dealerships. So if you happen to buy a Tata product, get a thorough background check of the dealership you are buying from.


3. If you are a sedate driver and drive in city only then you can't go wrong with Wagon R. Yes the car is flimsy and get dents and bents easily but it is a low maintenance and reliable car.

4. Imho Wagon R suits you. And if you ask me what is my choice then i won't go for either of them. I will look for a middle ground and for me it's provided by Hyundai.

5. Also cheap service of MS is a myth, they charge almost the same as other brands are charging now.

Also in one instance , they claim their way of treatment is the best and on another , they want to copy and implement from modern medicine. The irony is tooo much here.

She met a guy 4 years ago through sms, classic fraud love story, and left everyone to be with him. She saw the guy for the first time when she arrived at the station. He was a 50 something dude, she regretted for a bit but had no choice and stayed with him, she feared returning would be fatal.

They married in a temple, the guy tore the documents, anything which would show their marriage as legitimate. She didn't stop, because she trusted him. He was usual abusive, he beat her and emotionally played her every time. Sometimes later she discovered that he has 2 other wives as well. So this guy would jump between wives, abuse them, leave them, stay with another and go back when he felt like it.

He moved this girl to a new place, adjacent to my apartment, we saw him beat her once, obviously intervened. Few days later the guy disappears. This girl thought he was kidnapped by his ex wife who allegedly threatened him to do so. The guy is also a lowly criminal, steals and sells the stolen stuff (yeah I live in a dump actually). Anyway later our suspicions were right, he dumped her.

He didn't leave her any money, when she called the society for help, they actually turner against her and wanted to evict her, they are waiting for the end of lockdown to do that. She tried police, they asked for money and threatened to arrest her instead, called her really inappropriate things. NCW also denied help, we tried local foundation and ngo, no one is willing to help and blaming her.

We even asked the girl to try and put the baby for adoption, she doesn't agree, can't blame her for that. But the baby drinks packaged milk, which we are providing right now. We have tried everything, I am broke as well or I would have helped her financially for sometime, but I quit my job at a very bad time.

So basically she is proper f**d if I put it bluntly, given time she can get back on her feet, but I'm more concerned about the baby, as she is very distraught, doesn't eat for few days, we actually force her. There's only so much anyone can bear before snapping. I am concerned that she might take her life if things don't work out.

When she pleaded with the guy for help you know what he said, ""that's your matter"". I've never wanted to hurt someone so bad before. So now we might have 5 days left before the lockdown ends, and people here will evict her for sure, forgot to mention that her rent is due as well. Is there anyway to help her get some shelter or some work? I've called so many places and they all turned out to be useless, if the police won't help, who would? And to be honest I've completely lost faith in humanity.

Tl;dr : 24 year old neighbour got defrauded by husband (or something), no one is helping her, not even the cops.","I'll call this post a fake. Reasons below:

1. No mention of the city 
2. How did they move to your society, no documents for that guy? Shouldn't she file a FIR as her husband is lost? Is she being evicted/ if yes by whome?
3. You sound way too pessimistic on everyone who is trying to help you out. Seriously, police shouted on her? No Women commission is helping her?
4. Story about meeting a 50 year old guy meeting a 23 year old girl and getting married, and 😁 why are they using sms when everyone is using whatsapp.
5. Seriously she fucked up so bad, she can't even call her family?????

Note: If you're here for money from people who are going to DM you, i wish god gove them some brains. if you're just fishing for karma, then congratulations you just played everyone else. ",2020-05-12 16:23:12
1939,My recent email to OYO. Has anyone else faced something similar? What do you think is the best course of action from here on?,c7prdt,india,31,False,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/c7prdt/my_recent_email_to_oyo_has_anyone_else_faced/,5,Unverified,"Hello OYO,

We had fantastic holiday in Mysore and Ooty recently. The weather and sights were amazing and we were back home much relaxed and refreshed. It was a well earned and well enjoyed holiday for us both.
All this, despite the last minute stunt that you guys pulled to challenge our abilities to stay cool and sane on a holiday. 

So here’s what you guys did.

* On the __ of June, I had booked a room at Hotel Mahendra in Mysore for the __ of June. The booking number was ______________.  (Look it up; I dare you. I double dare you.)
* On the ___ I get a sms stating that our booking had been changed to Hotel Mysore Palace. We were not happy about this as we had put in considerable effort to find a hotel at walking distance from the actual Mysore Palace. We contacted customer care and spent the entire day of __ June trying to rectify this. Our request was simple, to find us a hotel close to the Mysore Palace and within the budget that we had originally booked Hotel Mahendra at.
* After numerous phone calls, tweets and instagram posts, I was contacted by one Mr. ____ and he helped us out by shifting our reservation to Hotel Ni Ambaari Suites. He informed us that we would need to pay Rs. 999/- to the hotel and the difference would be borne by OYO.
* We confirmed this at the hotel reception and got a positive response. As such we checked in and deposited our luggage in the room and moved out into the city.
* At ____, I get a sms asking us to click on a link to confirm our booking at Hotel Mahendra. Since we had already being allotted a different hotel and had checked in as well I ignored it. 
* At 8:30 p.m., we get a call from the Ni Ambarri reception desk stating that our booking had been cancelled by OYO.
* We got in touch with customer care numerous times, explained everything to multiple individuals without success. 
* Mr. ___ (customer care executive) assured us that we would get a call back in half an hour. We did not.
* The next morning, we spoke to one Mr. ______ (senior executive) and he actually stated that our case was “complicated”. He put us on hold, came back on the call after a couple of minutes and then PRETENDED not to be able to hear us. This was clear as:( a) he isn’t a very good actor to pull off such a trick and  (b) we hadn’t put the call on hold or gone off line. We were in the hotel room with perfectly good network.
He kept saying, “Am I audible?” over and over again even though he could hear us. He then proceeded to rattle off a standard script laying the blame squarely on the customer for not responding and then he cut the call. Presumably he must’ve done this to drop the hot potato (our situation) and let someone else handle it. (On a side note, he could’ve atleast tried to alter the tone and pitch of his voice to lend some credibility to his charade. Perhaps OYO HR can schedule some Voice Acting classes for the next company retreat.)
* Anyway, to get back to our ordeal, since we had no resolution forthcoming from OYO, we then had to pay the difference of the bill ourselves. 

So to summarize the situation, we had our original booking changed by OYO without any intimation; and then had it changed to a third hotel BUT at the price of our original booking (ok till here); and then inexplicably had that third hotel booking cancelled AFTER we had checked in because of which we were forced to pay the difference in the price of the room.

Thus, we have a few questions for OYO.

* Why was our booking cancelled from Ni Ambaari AFTER we had already checked in at the hotel?
* How does OYO plan to compensate us for the inconvenience and mental hassle that we had to endure on our well earned holiday? 

And most importantly,

* When will the HR department at OYO schedule some voice acting classes for its executives so that they can pull off deception in much more convincing manner? (I am willing to help you out with resource personnel for this).

Hope to hear from you soon, OYO. Or else, you’ll be hearing a lot more from us.","Yes. Not as Shitty as this one but quite  similar. Me and 3 of my friends ( 3 males 1 female) were travelling from Bangalore to Mumbai for a conference to be held at NITIE Powai. We looked for a hotel nearby and found a sweet ass hotel just a few Kms from the institute. The hotel policy didn't allow couples so we booked 2 rooms, one with single occupancy ( for the girl) and one with triple occupancy ( with extra bed for the three of us ) . Here's when shit went crazy. Couple of days before our journey , I called OYO to confirm my booking as we were 19 yr old noobs travelling over 2k Kms. No one had travelled this far without their families and wanted everything to be double checked. When I called them up, they said they had to cancel the booking as it violated the hotel policies (which it did not. We took care of that) and he had to shift us to a different hotel which was 30 Kms away from our conference place. All this happened without the information passed to me. I was shit pissed.  after numerous calls and shouting on the phone, they initially declined saying they couldn't revert back to the initial booking as it was full but after calls with an executive who was glib and couldn't care less of our problems, we got back our original booking at the earlier paid price. 

And guess what , when we reached the hotel which was a penthouse, the manager couldn't care less of couples being allowed, gave us a room which was on the 20th floor with an amazing view. Best stay ever!

Fuck you OYO! ",2019-07-01 15:50:08

EDIT : Why are you guys so triggered and abusive. Ok I may have an unpopular opinion but you can simply deny if you don't agree with me or at least try to bring up valid strong points on why can't govt do that. I'm not implying that I'm right, I'm just pointing out the possibilities

The problem with today's people is that for them an unpopular opinion is simply a conspiracy theory / traitor


Some of the guys here simply don't know what a civil discussion and debate is.

EDIT : removed the political content.

EDIT : What I said in removed content is that don't let any party to take advantage of this situation in coming elections. There will be people saying that this was an inside job and there will be people saying that we took your revenge (if another cross border operation happens). We all know what happened in 84. Everything is possible but for now just don't let anyone feed profit from this.

DO NOT let anyone take political leverage out of this.

Also this is what I think how could we defeat Pakistan:

We alone can't. Period. Pakistan is like your local gully goon who is backed by his vidhayak chacha(USA/UAE/PRC etc).
Those countries just give a Facebook message or tweet or speech that they condemn such behavior but continue business relationship and funding.

India should ASAP deny pak all business relationship/import/export/aids etc. Killing 20-30 puny soilders won't do anything. Go for the queen, go for the head. If USA and China understand that they are feeding a cancer and stop their transactions  Pakistan will be royally fucked in quarter of an year. They'll be literally begging on their knees in a condition far worse than any war could do.

But they won't. Because it's not their job or problem. We have to take first action. Juck make them untouchable. Fucking bycott Pakistan. No aid,no import,export, transport, sports nothing. Appel internationally to do the same. Appeal your allies to bycott Pakistan too.  Eventually we'll have an international group who support this. Small but effective.

This way we'll be hitting their head. Direct War and strike will just kill normal people, and poor fauzis who are just following orders. Strangle them the above way and eventually their own population will rebel them.",[removed] ,2019-02-15 14:57:32

After the money got deducted and I was going through the live tracking screen, I see that Zomato had automatically tipped the driver Rs.60.

I have no problem with tipping the rider, specially during these times, But tipping Rs.60 for an order which was not even worth Rs.300 is a little outrageous.

His CT scan showed minor signs of early onset of viral pneumonia. 

He's been having all the symptoms of cough/dry khansi, and fever since the last week. Fever comes and goes, and is often goes away completely for 5-7 hours after he takes Paracetamol. He's also taking 'giloy and Sudarsan ghanvati' tablets for fever. 

Since last 36 hours, his fever has been on and off but temp is high. He crossed 101 last night, and he's been sweating profusely mainly due to the Paracetamol from head to toe. He is taking steam and eating in small quantities, and he is feeling extremely weak. 

We're really worried and concerned as he's alone.

What else can be done in this stage by him? For those of you who experienced mild Covid/any form of Covid, did you go through the same? Anything we should be doing differently in terms of home treatment?

His colleagues prepared kaadha and gave him yesterday, which was very strong and my dad mentioned that it made him sweat even more. 

All his reports from few days back are absolutely fine, and even the CT scan as I mentioned earlier shows only minor signs, but given how he is right now - I'm really worried. I checked online and everywhere it says that you should only isolate and weather the storm, and you'll be fine.

**Start with the single ivermectin ASAP** and consult your doctor after that.

Ivermectin is one of the safest drugs ever made. You can take 2 x 12mg tablets for 2-3 days without any more side effects than diarrhoea. **I'm not saying you should**, I'm saying it is as safe as paracetamol or more.

So if you take one more than required or take one every other day it will not cause a problem. But there is a pretty good statistical chance that it will reduce the severity of symptoms, damage and inflammatory response of COVID

My mind was going through so much within past week that i broke multiple times and i thought i really don't have any other option than ask for money. As i said in the first line of my original post, i don't deserve it, and now i realise that i really don't. I got lots of positive advices and tips which i will follow up. I know i really didn't tried enough before coming here begging for money, i shouldn't have. I don't deserve. 

I know its hard to believe for you my story, it was hard to believe for me too. How can a person who loved his family can lose all his money on betting/gambling. Yep that's my dad for you. He really did it. I still can't believe. I am sorry i begged you all. I am sorry i was in hurry for quick cash from you (a comment notification i just got).

The sole reason i came here because i didn't know how to ask help from college, like what do i say? ""My dad lost his money in gambling, so help me with that"", they wouldn't care, why would they. 

When i did wrote this post i never really thought i would get this many comments, there are still 85 notifications. I don't know how to verify my story. It's ok, if you think its fake. I hope this is fake and this all is a dream for me. 

To all the people, who gave me support, thanks again. 

To everyone who told me to work, yes i will do it. I just made this post without thinking. I was not prepared for this to come, so i wasn't ready to just work. My mind is really messed up now, i just don't its not that fucking depression.
I know working and earning is the best solution for me, But even if i start working today, i can't really pay for this semester cause till when i will make enough money this semester is gonna end that's why i made a post to beg money.

I never thought of year break, which now seems the best option for me. Thanks for this advice.

To everyone who thinks i am scammer, you just got a solid thing to prove your point, because i am removing my donation link. Yes i am scammer, and I can't prove my thing. Fuck me. But really your comments helped me too making me realise that getting money is not easy. Thanks for that.

I was just mentally broked up and nervous, and thousands of thoughts were going in my mind, so i just made a post for desperate help. I literally thought getting money from funding is easy, and all i was planning for how will i complete my next two years. 

I re-read my own post and to me too it seems such a scam. I wouldn't donate money to me. 

Fuck you dad.

I just want to write so much more, but i really don't know what to write. My life has become such a mess in no time. I can't really imagine whats next for me.

I promise you all i will work hard from today. I don't know what i will do but i will do something. I will come back from this. 

Thank you for all your support, i will read all the comments again tomorrow. Some of them really helped me today. Some comments almost broke me again. Some new comments i have yet to read. I will remember this post forever. I am gonna remember this day. I don't believe in god but may god give me enough power to overcome from this.

Today i realise why everyone believes in god, its because in your hard time god gives you faith. Fuck me guys

As for people telling to apply for edu loan, i did applied but it didn't got cleared, here's the proof: http://imgur.com/a/05eaAbP

The site didn't updated but the manager has already told me  that he can't do it mid year and apply again next year, i really don't know why the loan didn't passed, my dad just told me this.

I am begging you all. I know i don't really deserve it, i am not the brightest in studies, but i want to give myself last chance.

My dad fucked up the financial condition of my family. And it's bothering me so much. I can't really depend on him now.
He lost a lot of money in betting/gambling and now is in debt. I know that's all my father's fault and for his fault i don't really want to drop out of college mid-sem when i was not really prepared for this.

This is my 4th sem, third week of college is going on and I am still sitting at home. I didn't attend a single day in college this semester. Please help me pay this semester fees. I don't know what i will do for the next four semesters, how i am going to arrange money for that, maybe i will drop out, but till then at least i will be prepared for dropping out. Now i am not. My father has fucked up so bad was like a bomb dropping on me. In college, he didn't let me realize that so much problems are going in family. In this winter break when i returned home that's when i realized the situation is too bad. That's why he asked me to apply for education loan again and for whatever reason the manager didn't pass it, saying he can't do this mid year etc etc.
Its not only my fees that is not paid but my younger sisters school fees too. But I don't really care about that now. I just care now is for going back to college anyhow.

Please don't tell me in this thread how to earn money etc. I will make a separate thread for that because now i don't got time to earn and pay college fees. All i could ask now is your help and donations for this sem. I don't know how i am going to pay for next two years, but I promise each and everyone of you i will work hard. Maybe i will write code, work part time, serve table, beg or suck my chairman's dick. I don't really know what's coming ahead of me in my life but please help me this time. 

I am short of ₹38000 for college fees and another ₹45000 for my hostel fees. Since hostel accepts part payment i will be good if i pay them ₹20000 now. 
So in total i need ₹58000 now to attend college. I don't know if i can raise this much for college. But anything raised will be better than nothing.

I don't know any crowd funding sites so please help me with that. I don't really know what to do now please help me. I was not really prepared for this. Everything seems to be on verge of destroying for me. 

I WAS NOT PREPARED FOR THIS DAD. I hate you.

PLEASE HELP ME r/india

Edit: here are college fees and my dues details: https://imgur.com/a/67ZKJSc

I can't find the receipt now, i am still finding it. The paid fees details are taken from my college portal. I request anyone of you to take some time and i will message you my college login id to verify this from college website. You can call my college and ask. 

As for hostel, i didn't got a fee structure for that nor i got my payment receipt, because i never thought it was important to keep. I can give my hostel warden contact to verify, if someone is willing to do. 


Thanks for all your support! 
I will post the funding link only when someone verify as i saw a comment that this is a scam. I know, if i saw something like this without proof i wouldn't trust, i know you want proof. Please help me verify. 
Please suggest a site for crowdfunding too which is easy to set up now.

Edit 2: here i found something for hostel receipt. I transferred through phonepe so here is the details from that. https://imgur.com/a/51U6H1l

What should I do?,jukz8j,india,86,False,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/jukz8j/my_7_month_old_baby_has_fever_probably_covid_and/,39,Coronavirus,"Yesterday Night I (35 M) got symptoms of mild fever (body ache) which usually happen to me due to tiredness and a single dose of Paracetamol before I go to sleep solves the matter.
Today the morning I checked my temperature and it was around 98.8F, but I still have symptoms of body ache.
Me and my son (7 months old, weighing 8~9kg) has mild symptoms of coughing yesterday. I thought it was due to pollution in Delhi/NCR area.

Today afternoon around 2PM my fever raised to 100F and I isolated myself in another room and orderd Covid19 test which is scheduled on Tuesday Morning. 
At 5PM my wife informed me that my son is also having Fever around 100F, and now I am shit scared. As 2 people has fever together, so it is most probably Covid.
My wife shows no symptoms yet. 

I called to my regular pediatric doctor and he recommended me to give Solvin Cold drops (Chlorpheniramine Maleate (1mg) + Paracetamol (125mg) + Phenylephrine (2.5mg)) 3 time a day and wait for 2 days and keep a watch for any other symptoms.

For myself, I am having Azithromycin, Vitamin C, Zinc, Paracetamol and drinking hot/warm water.

I am shit scared for my son, he is just 7 months old. What should I do?

Update: I don't have fever from morning. But mild cough. Got myself tested(RT-PCR) an hour ago and reports will be arriving by evening.
Baby still have fever around 100F and an appointment with pediatric doctor is scheduled today.

Update2: Consulted a pediatrician. Thanks to u\altji
Doc said not to worry and hopefully fever will go away in few days. Asked to wait for my reports first. If I'm positive then baby is also positive. Prescribed ALLEGRA and PARACETAMOL for now and asked to report him for any other symptoms occur.

Update3: My result came in today afternoon and I am Covid Positive. 
My wife started showing symptoms of coughing, body ache and mild fever (100F) since yesterday.
Doctor added 2~3 more medicines to my routine ..
Favipiravir, 
Ivermact 12mg, 
Doxycycilin, 
Drinking Hot water / Taking Steam(everyone is taking it including baby) / Trying to drink lots of fluids
Me and baby did not show any fever today we have very mild cough. Baby is active but little less than usual.  Got my wife and my brothers tested today as we all live together. Reports will come tomorrow.
For Baby doctor said to give Paracetamol 1ml drop if he has fever and Azee Drops if cough.

**Update 1:** Father is diagnosed with Acute Leukaemia. Doctors says the amount in Pvt. could go 10 Lakh and in govt. Half of it. Other than that with the current information in mind the risk to save him is very very low as of his old age. There will be more test to confirm the type of Acute Leukaemia and after that they say it's upto us to start the treatment or not, keeping the risk in mind. I am really upset about the situation.

**Update 2:** Bone Marrow Biopsy is underway to accurately diagonse which type of Leukaemia it is, what treatment to follow, risk of coming back. And I learned about the whole Leukaemia thing and i predict it's possibly AML (myeloid). What i know about AML treatment, it itself is really expansive, needs a whole month blood products for transfusion, and sadly, the treatment itself is life threatening.

I recently asked the internet to help in arranging blood units. After getting 3 SDPs and some tests it is revealed that my Father (63) have Leukemia (Blood Cancer). We admitted him in MMI Narayana Raipur in the emergency (you could see my old post). We told our Diabetes Doctor that we won't be able to afford any kind of expensive treatments, the doctor too said she was upset about the situation and told that if we start the treatment in Private Hospital it will cost about 8 lakhs (which i cannot be sure) and recommended to take into Govt. Hospital. Tomorrow i will be talking about the current situation in detail with the Cancer Specialist Doctor that our Diabetes Doctor has referred to. I will take any decision after talking with the doctor tomorrow. *(i gotta be quick tomorrow)*

So, my plans are, to admit my father into AIIMS Raipur (Our Diabetes doctor said she will help in referral and management as much as she could) since we literally couldn't afford treatments in lakhs (No income source) even if i'll be able to arrange through my local relations, i can't say for high cost. Also Govt. Hospital system and management is the worst you could imagine. If i got to know that we could have treatment at affordable cost i am thinking about taking into Vedanta Balco Raipur (non-profit Cancer Specialist hospital) but i am unsure of their motives or about how much we have to spend there or whether they could take the best care of the situation. I will like if any of you who fully understand the situation and have knowledge of, to suggest what actions should i take.

It'll be good to know if someone has experience with Balco Vedanta and also about Leukemia. About how much it could cost or if we should just seek for govt. Hospital etc.

2002,Why do these motorcycle manufacturers replace the back brake with combi brakes and not the front one?,kafmgf,india,4,False,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/kafmgf/why_do_these_motorcycle_manufacturers_replace_the/,10,Science/Technology,"So for a few years now we have had  many manufacturers add ""combi brakes"" (one lever engages both front and back brakes) to their motorcycles to enhance safety, but so far I've seen all of them add it instead of the back brakes, this seems counterintuitive as usually having your back wheels lockup is better than your front wheels. And in the couple vehicles I've got my hands on right out of the showroom the combi brakes are always configured to engage the front brakes first before back brakes, this seems outright dangerous as I've had my front wheels lockup and nearly lose control (that's when I checked and adjusted the brakes).

What is the logic behind doing something that seems stupid and dangerous to me? I'm hoping there's a sane explanation since these things are designed by people who know their shit","Other guy has explained it very well. Id chime in a few points.

When you are braking your suspension compresses transferring the weight to the tyres which in turn increases friction if this process is not given time you have lockups or skidding, what you want to do is load the suspension and then increase braking without loosing traction. 

Think of brake lever as a sponge don't squeeze them all at once do it gradually and increase pressure just two fingers or three at max is enough. 

I suggest you move to an ABS bike, these days many motorcycles come with them, they are good for both experienced and beginner riders. ",2020-12-10 21:53:14

I need your opinions to prove my mother wrong.,k7tdv6,india,19,False,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/k7tdv6/gen_z_younger_millenials_of_india_i_need_your/,40,AskIndia,"Yesterday, my mom told me that my older cousin (22) is looking to get married. She is a Chartered accountant (or going to be one? Idk..i dont keep up with her ). But i was surprised this 22y/o child wants to get married. She is only 3 years older than me.

My cousin comes from a very poor family. She has an alcoholic for a dad . Ive heard horror stories from her about how she was preparing for her board exams  while her dad was hitting her mom in the other room. Now she wants to get married because she thinks marriage is her only ticket out of poverty and this miserable life . I dont mind that. Sure, her life, her choices. But she is a CA for heaven sake. She can make enough money to pull atleast 3 families out of poverty if she wanted to. Why get married for that? But the thought that women can only be successful with a man is ingrained in the poor girls head and she is acting upon it. Again, if thats what she wants to do with her life, who am I to judge her? 

But she wants an Arranged marriage. 
 
I have nothing against arranged marriage. But I just thought people in our generation didnt believe in arranged marriage. I thought we gave more value to love over status or pleasing out relatives. When i told my mom this she said that I was wrong and that kids these days ARE going back to arrabged marriage. When I told her no, she said that I was being influenced by western media and I should spend more time with Indian teens/young adults (I dont live in India. None of my Indian friends approve of AM). She also said something along the lines of how young adults these days choose to have kids before 30 because they want to grow older with the kids. From what ive read people are choosing not to have kids at all !!

My mom told me not to worry about marriage or kids now and to focus on my studies now But..Im 19. I'll be 22 in a few years. Will I be excepted to get married then? Shit, im scared.

So..r/India, Am I the one wrong here? Did the young population revert back to this age old tradition? Am I just living a fairy taillife expecting to find ny own prince charming and getting married whenever i want when it wont happen?


Edit: My mother had always thought me and my sister that only a woman who is well educated and has a good career can fight back against patriarchy. She always taught us to be independednt so that we dont have to depend on a man. Hell, my parents had a love marriage. I can't understand when she changed her way of thinking.","I don't think you're mother is entirely wrong. But she is definitely wrong in putting an entire generation into one single basket. In my general observation things for current gen are going in the following ways and can be classified accordingly. I can't speak for your cousin but kids in general, subconsciously don't want to go against their parents. They might not even realize it but every decision they take is influenced by their upbringing even if they feel they have the freedom of choice. Millenials from Orthodox families are conditioned to get an arranged marriage, have a big fat wedding and move on. That's just the way of life. Now, this is Type 1.

Moving on, there are families with a fairly moderate outlook. These kids know that their parents are ok (with a little convincing) with them getting married to whosever they choose (within reasonable limits of course, for example inter-religion or ethnicity would be a big no). This group forms the majority of people I know. The important thing among these people is that although the pressure to get an arranged marriage isn't there, the pressure to get married is always there. They don't want to see their kids single in their 30's. So the pressure to get married begins once the kids hit 25. A lot of people I know are in this age group, and don't have a serious relationship that they consider is marriage worthy. Some of them have tried multiple times and failed. At some point they just throw hands 🤷‍♂️ and let their parents take over. This is type 2.

There are also family with a complete liberal outlook. However, like myself, the kid could be ultra socially awkward incel weeb with zero chances of landing a girl. They can't find anyone and the prospect of dying alone scares them. At some point they might just cave in and consider arranged marriage as an option. This is type 3. ",2020-12-06 21:01:44

 I believe in Free Markets, and think this bill is going to be kind of good for the country, but not for the exact same reasons BJP is saying.
Here is *what I think* about these reforms.


###1. Increase investment in agriculture


This one is obvious, as corporates and private companies will enter agriculture they will introduce more machinery and technology to maximize profit.

###2. Agriculture Productivity will increase as a result of investments


before I begin, here's a SHOCKING fact: 

Average Caloric Intake is falling in India since 1991. yes you heard that right, falling not increasing. various reasons have been suggested like food budget squeeze, but I'm not getting into all of that(you can google ""India's calorie consumption puzzle""). 

imo, not liberalising agriculture back in 1991 is one of the reason. (all those subsidies, price controls, loan waivers failed)

Agriculture Productivity has not increased much compared to the growth in population.


###3. Farmers income may/may not increase, but does it actually matter?


So this is the crux of the debate. Farmers income will increase or remain same depending on whether farmers are able to form cooperatives or not, whether cartels are formed by government lobbying, but anyway I'm leaving that aside for now.

basically agriculture employment has to decrease in the long run.

 chances are corporates and private companies will try to buy the farms, since land consolidation is much better for them to handle and implement technology. kinda ""economies of scale"" concept. It's not like farmers will be forced to sell, eventually it's bound to happen anyway. people move away from agriculture to manufacturing and service sector.
This is where we have to make a choice. Prioritise Farmers or prioritise growth in Agriculture and Industry?

this is how every country develops but we are constantly trying hard to ""protect the farmers"", which nevertheless we failed. private enterprises must enter agriculture in large scale.


###4. Will make food cheaper

higher productivity, more supply, cheap food. I don't know what else to write here. pretty much that's it. it would greatly help with tackling malnutrition.


**tl;dr** : free markets won't necessarily favor farmers but it will favour productivity and structural change of employment.

In a way the government is willing to ""risk"" farmers wellbeing for better Productivity in agriculture.

Background: I(M24) have been with my girlfriend(F24) for around 1 and a half year now. Our relationship isn't the most stable, my GF has anger issues and I am not the most easily forgiving person either. We fight quite a bit. A few weeks ago, after a major fight my girlfriend told me ""let's not commit right now, let's see each other but not commit"" I was okay with that, I don't really love her or anything, and I keep thinking about other women all the time. Additionally, I'm a virgin while she's had a relationship before and lost her virginity in that. I've always wanted to have my first time with a girl I actually loved and cared about, and possibly was married to.

We've made out in the past. Indulged in some fingering but that was it. Today, we decided to meet for a short while in our favorite spot where we always do. We sat and talked. Long story short, one thing led to another and we ended up having sex. Being my first time, it was all over in 5-7 minutes. After I was finished, I sat there in a daze. My GF asked for water and wanted to clean up. I sat there, as if I'd been stupefied. It took her repeating herself thrice before I paid attention to her.

Even as I type this, it is very difficult for me to come to terms with my feelings about the entire affair. Even after we bid each other goodbye and I walked to my apartment, I walked in a daze, where I was mechanically doing everything without really thinking about it. I looked around and I literally had trouble perceiving the world. Its like, I took in the sights and sounds but my brain wasn't processing them.

I feel no joy. I feel no happiness that I had sex barely 2 hours ago. All I feel is a void, where some sense of gratification should be. I don't love this girl. We fight so much. And who knows what complications this might lead to. I want some love, I want to be able to look into a woman's eyes and know she's the one for me as I have sex with her. I don't feel this way about my current gf. And I hate this feeling. This is why I had refused to have sex with her so far. I have never felt so distant from her as I do right after having had sex with her. This is a bad sign, right?

I don't want to say she made me do it. True, it was she who took her pants off and pulled me towards her, and guided my penis inside her. True, but I was there . I could have stopped her. And she probably wouldn't have resisted. I did not. I could have said no, but for some reason I didn't. I don't want to pretend like I was forced into sexual activity. I was there with my consent.

She is very happy about us finally having sex. I am not. It just feels wrong.

So right now I'm highschool droppout and have 2 years of highschool yet to complete... So my anxiety started back in 7th grade when I was 13 I'm 17 now. >!I was so close to killing myself that day.!<

Um, I don't remember exact date but it was sports day, everbody was on the ground preparing for sports except me and my fellow classmates and some seniors. I honestly didn't expected anything bad to happen that day, but it happened anyways.
I was got beaten by my own classmates in a room which was supposed to be used as a staff room but was unoccupied at that time being. If I had to go into detail, it was my friends who was about to be dragged into that room but like an idiot I tried to save him, they got me instead. Anyways, it's a secret i didn't tell anybody irl what happened inside it but telling on internet anyways, their first attempt was to stripe me naked and take my photo and post them on social media. _I'm crying right now while writing it_ they didn't succeed so one of them slapped me, they were total nine of them. Then one guy started fighting with me, I was helpless against those boys. They bullied me, hit me, tortured me both physically and mentally for more than an hours. Not to mention few persons whom I considered friend were also involved in this and enjoyed watching me in pain, crying. The person whom I saved simply get away and started playing games since that was sports day. 

I was saved by luck, but it ruined my image anyways. There was a rumour that I was >!raped!< in that room and like they made me >!suck their dicks!<. School didn't do anything, they instead cover it my by stating everything as my mistake like ""what you were doing there, when you must be in ground?"" ""It's all your fault, you can't blame school?"" 
That rumours ruined my image so well that it's somehow still there even after four years. I honestly somehow lived in that school for 2 more years, living in same room as person who bullied me. It led me to intense mental breakdown sometimes where i just cry in front of everyone in classroom. It destroyed my will to live, I started self-harming since then. It showed effects in my marksheet too— my grades gradually started declining and now I officially failed 10th boards on 2 subjects.  If being honest, which i am since who in internet knows where i live or anything about me, I considered suicide few times. I tried it too like death by drowning but was saved and didn't even end up in hospital. 
Anyways, school or parents honestly never cared about me, let alone my my health. They always said I was lying and overreacting. And since I had two siblings who never demanded for anything it was so hard for me to even ask for anything out of their will. 

So yeah, that's my life until now. I've only been enough to psychiatrist so he could diagnose me with shit. Rest doesn't matter for anybody, I'm helpless 17yo anyways. I also feel like I'm about to be kicked out of my house as soon as I turn 18. Also, I hate them on personal level. I hold serious grudge against them. I hope they did and their parents suffer for all the suffering i had bcs of them.

Today the Cabinet Secretariat issued a notification under the business of allocation rules stating that digital and online media falls within the jurisdiction of the Ministry of Information and Broadcasting (MIB). The notification essentially means that MIB will have principal jurisdiction over, *first* online news and current affairs content and *second* films and audiovisual programmes made available by online content providers (also called OTT providers).

So the question arises what does this change mean? And second, why is there a level of apprehension that arises due to it?  


https://preview.redd.it/5qncqv42mly51.png?width=994&format=png&auto=webp&s=1162373061b2d5561311025a23e0fb26feb5218d

**What does this mean?**  


Here it is first important to take a step back and consider the role the MIB has played conventionally. It has administered both licensing and content censorship powers in the radio, cinema and television broadcasting specifically through laws such as the Cinematograph Act and the Cable Television Regulations Act. Hence, it has an institutional history of regulation.  


This has been done both with respect to entities are permitted to operate within certain sectors of news and general entertainment but also indirectly exercised governance over content. For instance film certification which is popularly known as being done through censor boards. Now, the online content sector is also enveloped within the ambit of the MIB somewhat similarly to radio, cinema and television. However, there is largely an absence of legislation that may require either licensing or a form of content certification like for movies.  


**Why is there nervousness?**  


We all know the internet is a very different medium than cinemas or theaters. It presents different challenges and opportunities. Here there exists a level of nervousness as to whether today’s notification can be a precursor to any form of licensing or result in censorship.  


* Journalism Platforms: Here there is a level of anticipation firstly with respect to who all would fall within the ambit of such regulation and what would be its nature. We believe that online media and journalism is vital to our democracy and present innovative models through which specialised services focussing through models of subscriptions or news-letters provide incredible value to end users. Furthermore, even the type of content which may be investigative, or specialised focussing on topical subjects like technology and startups are serving real value and need. Here, there is a degree of nervousness about what shape any potential regulation or a legislation will take. One such measure is the pending process that considers amendments to [**the Press and Registration of Books Bill, 2019**](https://internetfreedom.in/say-no-to-overregulation-of-digital-news-media-and-social-media/). Now, it’s an open question, whether this, or any other legislative measures, will cause censorship or bring in compliances that while aimed at checking social problems such as, “fake news” may just result in greater government control?
* Online video streaming platforms (such as Amazon Prime, Disney-Hotstar, Netflix): To be clear this would mark a clear departure from the past stand of principally the Ministry of Electronics and IT (MEITY) and joined by the MIB which had in the [***Justice for Rights Case*** **made a submission** ](https://internetfreedom.in/take-it-and-go/)that there was no need for regulation under the Cinematograph Act for prior licensing of content. Further, if any complaints arose against online streaming providers then offences under the Information Technology Act, 2000 and the Indian Penal Code, 1860 were available. We even sent a letter to MEITY congratulating them for this progressive stand. However, there are signs that such statements [**may not be equivocal and there may be a Cinematographer style regulation**](https://internetfreedom.in/a-certifiable-dampener/). According to us this would be a very bad idea for freedom of speech and media diversity. It would hurt creators, viewers and the cultural export and local content development of diverse content which is showcasing India’s creative, soft power on the global stage.  


So in both instances, while nervousness is understandable, please do consider adoption of some caution and paying greater attention to any potential legislative or executive action which may follow. Such policy shifts will be documented by us and we will keep you regularly informed and seek your active participation.  


**Vigilance and continued liberty**  


At IFF we are committed to serving the constitutional values of free expression that quite often today intersect with digital communication. We believe that any regulation of the online sector which may follow should be grounded in sound public policy choices which carry these values and also serve innovation.

My college, Manipal Institute of Technology is calling back almost 4000+ students from across India within a span of 2 weeks, in addition to the university calling back students for its Health sciences campus, (KMC etc). The total number could be as high as 10000+. All to a college town with not enough medical facilities. 

They're doing so in the name of conducting offline labs and end semester exams, across a duration of 45 days, during which we'll need to be on campus / in hostels. Single rooms aren't available for everyone and there are common washrooms in every hostel. In addition to that, there is also a huge crowding problem in college messes.  Any logical person can see that this isn't going to end well. Oh, and also there is no quarantine requirement for 2 weeks. There is only health 'screening' on reporting to campus after which you can go to your rooms.

There are a lot of UGC guidelines for reopening that are being flouted, but being an Institute of Eminence, they can probably get away with it. 

They have also given an illusion of choice with there being 3 options - 

1) Exams and labs now in nov-dec

2) Exams in dec, labs in June 2021

3) Exams and labs in June-July 2021

However, many students have their Internships/ placements lined up with companies unwilling to adjust 30-45 days next year. In addition to that student applying for Higher education need their mark-sheets, and hence option 1 is the only one that isn't hurting career prospects. 

MAHE expects us to have faith in the system but then they don't give us a single reason to do so. There's no transparency, no real choice, no say in the decisions that directly affect our lives. We as students are trying our best using Twitter (#ManipalForOnlineExams) and writing emails to the college, but they are conveniently being ignored. Any suggestions?","You guys are perfectly healthy 20 year old young adults living in a country where we are exposed to many more pathogens then our western counterparts.

For example - when I was younger in school and college - the vegetarians wouldn’t sit on the same table if I ordered non veg. 
Or they create an issue if someone advertises about non vegetarian food. 

It’s ridiculous, when did your religious beliefs give you the right to be intolerable toward others ? 

Doesn’t Hindu culture promote acceptance of all and live and let live ? 

What good is your abstinence of non vegetarian food if you’re just an asshole that makes people feel lesser because they’re different


EDIT - a lot of people are focusing only on the sitting on a different table part of the argument. But that was merely an example. Which hurt a 9 year old me. What triggered today’s rant was me being part of this WhatsApp group where someone advertised some non veg sushi & a lot of Jains / vegetarians were offended with it as they claimed such an advertisement hurt their religious sentiments 

So I proceeded to create another group where everyone was welcome and then they kicked me out of the first one.

So I don’t mean to say that all vegetarians are assholes but the ones that behave so are. And unfortunately, I’ve come across a LOT of the kind.","no hindu culture doesnt promote acceptance of all life form. if you want to kill animals and eat them like a savage, dont do it at my table.its okay if you like it, i am not obliged to respect you because of your choices ",2020-09-18 17:53:52

They can also fuck your life up. When my business went through hard times I had to settle my card and take a credit rating hit for five years.

Here are a few of my personal learnings about debt in general:

1. Take debt for capital expenditure only.
Things which will earn you more money in the long run. Like education loan, loan for factory machinery, etc.

2. Do not take debt for consumables or day to day expenditure. No carry forward of credit card balance for Amazon shopping.

But that's not the main problem here, the main problem is it's very difficult to criticize Hinduism. Unlike other major religions Christianity and Islam, Hinduism suffers from a dissociative identity disorder. Many people argue that it's *a way of life* or *a cultural identity* unique to the sub-continent and not a mainstream religion. But in reality, it's very evidently a religion. When someone questions the verses of the holy scriptures, the best reply they get is *'Oh! we Hindus don't follow our scriptures very strictly like the Muslims & Christians*'. When someone questions certain practices in Hinduism they blame it on the culture, tradition & society, even if they are the ones who said Hinduism is a way of life, not simply a religion. This double standard confuses many young people trying to question their faiths and in the end, they give up and reconcile themselves believing that Hinduism is not completely evil like other western religions. Many people still can't comprehend the evils of the caste system and how it has affected the lives of the lower caste communities for thousands of years. Even I was living in denial, back when I was a kid I believed that the *varna system* in Hinduism is not evil and the evil caste system was created by the British. At least that's what I was taught when I first questioned that system.

Many smart Hindus argue that you can be an atheist and still be Hindu because there were many ancient atheistic schools in India, like the *Charvaka*. But the thing is Charvaka was an exception in Hinduism, not the rule. Many other ancient cultures were quite similar too, who were absolutely materialistic and atheistic. Claiming that they were all modern secular humanists who considered nothing but science would be even more wrong. There's nothing common between modern-day atheism and those ancient cultures except disbelief in supernatural. I still don't get how someone is a modern-day atheist and still be a Hindu culturally or otherwise.",[deleted] ,2019-09-09 17:53:08

While they clarified to NDTV publicly with the following statement:

> Thanks for raising your concern. The policy mentions expansive definitions which may not be warranted & can be misconstrued. We’ll re-evaluate the Policy & make necessary amends. Customer privacy is paramount to us. We don’t collect customer info beyond what’s permissible by law. Thanks - [Himanshu M](http://srkl.in/l/6015BLwjMt)

Basically PR speak for - *""Our privacy policy was too transparent and we'll correct that. Meanwhile we will continue to collect all information about you that the law permits.""* 

And true to their words, that's exactly what they've done. 

The earlier policy (last updated: 08th October, 2020) stated:

> Personal information collected and held by us may include but not limited to your name, father’s name, mother’s name, spouse’s name, date of birth, current and previous addresses, telephone number, mobile phone number, email address, occupation and information contained in the documents used as proof of identity and proof of address. airtel and its authorized third parties may collect, store, process **following types of Sensitive Personal Information such as Genetic Data, Biometric Data, Racial or Ethnic Origin, Political opinion, Religious & Philosophical belief, Trade union membership, Data concerning Health, Data concerning natural personal's sex life or sexual orientation, password**, financial information (details of Bank account, credit card, debit card, or other payment instrument details), **physiological information** for providing our products, services and for use of our website. We may also hold information related to your utilization of our services which may include your call details, your browsing history on our website, location details and additional information provided by you while using our services.

And the latest policy (last updated: 17th October, 2020) now says: 

> Personal information collected and held by us may include but not limited to your name, father's name, mother's name, spouse's name, date of birth, current and previous addresses, telephone number, mobile phone number, email address, occupation and information contained in the documents used as proof of identity and proof of address. airtel and its authorized third parties may **also** collect, store, process **Sensitive Personal Information which may include but be not limited to password** and financial information (details of Bank account, credit card, debit card, or other payment instrument details), for providing our products, services and for use of our website. We may also hold information related to your utilization of our services which may include your call details, your browsing history on our website, location details and additional information provided by you while using our services.

So basically what they've done is to just say that they will continue collecting ""Sensitive Personal Information"" but stopped in defining what that includes. The earlier policy was more transparent.",Airtel is a good company but not number one at the time.

Of the things I heard,What triggered him to commit this bold act was the extensive abuse by the higher officials of my college.I honestly think they went too far with their punishments.First they snatched his phone,called his parents and abused him over the phone(on live call).He cried for hours.The abuse was too critical he hit his limit.Standing for 5 hours,abused every constant minute by professors and HOD,Removing him from placements,Breaking up with his girlfriend ,Exam pressure and losing his parents' trust.Later the HOD wouldn't give back his phone and informed that he will return it once he clears all his arrears.Unsure of what to do,he took the easy way out.This is the first time such an act is taking place in my college.Needless to say everyone is shocked.Who am i to say what must he have been through?But I do know he was depressed and had been abused.This all happened so fast it went by like a breeze,I really don't know man.....Is verbal and mental abuse the only way to punish students?!

A couple of months ago I came across WhiteHat Jr. and to say the very least the whole rigmarole made me chuckle. There's a lot of shady stuff these guys are doing to keep their shit under the carpet. First, it was the videos, where the tutor calls cloud-computing infinite space in the air that can store how much ever data. That video was downvoted to hell and then deleted.

Then learned a little about their hiring process. Even if you don't have a background in computer science, it doesn't matter. You're covered with a line-for-line script from hello to talking about Chintu the Google developer (like it literally highlights how you should appreciate a kid too). All these people need to make sure is that their talk is sold to their parents. Here's a link to that document: [https://gofile.io/d/WZgy2d](https://gofile.io/d/WZgy2d).

It was definitely after seeing Pradeep Poonia's post that I realized this contribution helps to the case. Teachers just memorize the whole script and at places where it lacks they can just conjure up anything because they are teaching kids at the end of the day. I don't have a problem with them teaching this to kids, but the fact that even one sessions' document is 50-pages long with such descriptive illustrations and such goes to show how these people aren't giving these pdfs to anyone specialized in the field. Even the GitHub accounts linked were fake, I tried searching for them and they don't exist now. All the video links in the pdf are also unlisted.

I am not going to disclose how I got hands on this document and RIP account.

In effect, the state of Jammu and Kashmir will now cease to exist; it will be replaced by two new Union Territories: Jammu and Kashmir, and Ladakh. UTs have become states earlier; **this is the first time that a state has been converted into a UT.** The UT of Jammu and Kashmir will have an Assembly, like in Delhi and Puducherry. The UT of Ladakh will not, like Chandigarh.

So, not only has Jammu and Kashmir lost its special status, it has been given a status lower than that of other states.

It is also likely that corporates and individuals will be able to buy land in Jammu and Kashmir. Non-Kashmiris might now get jobs in Kashmir. A process of demographic change might begin, and progress over the coming decades.

# Indian Opinion

Writing in the [Indian Express |  The story of Indian democracy written in blood and betrayal  ](https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/columns/jammu-kashmir-article-370-scrapped-special-status-amit-shah-narendra-modi-bjp-5880797/), Pratap Bahnu Mehta says

>This is a state for whom the only currency that matters is raw power. This is a state that recognises no constraints of law, liberty and morality. This is a state that will make a mockery of democracy and deliberation. This is a state whose psychological principle is fear. This is a state that will make ordinary citizens cannon fodder for its warped nationalist pretensions.

>India has betrayed its own constitutional promises. India has many asymmetric federalism arrangements outside of Kashmir. This act potentially sets the precedent for invalidating all of them. How can we justify offering Nagaland asymmetric federalism but deny it to Kashmir? Its implication is that the government can unilaterally declare any existing state to be a Union Territory. This is a constitutional first. We are simply a union of Union Territories that happen to be a state at the discretion of the Centre.

>What is playing out in Kashmir is the warped psyche of a great civilisation at its insecure worst. The BJP thinks it is going to Indianise Kashmir. **But, instead, what we will see is potentially the Kashmirisation of India: The story of Indian democracy written in blood and betrayal.**

Writing in [The Wire | Constitution Torn to Shreds as RSS Indulges Article 370 Fantasy in Kashmir](https://thewire.in/politics/constitution-torn-to-shreds-as-rss-indulges-article-370-fantasy-in-kashmir) Siddharth Varadarajan says

>Not only has Union home minister Amit Shah stripped Article 370 of its essence, he has gone one step further and abolished the entire state as well, replacing it with two ‘Bantustans’ – grandly called ‘union territories’ – in which key decisions on a range of issues like law and order and land will be taken not by the people and their elected representatives, but by bureaucrats from New Delhi.

>Except, J&K has already enjoyed the rigours of Central rule for nearly 10 of the past 45 years, and has turned out none the better for it. The last 12 months have seen Prime Minister Narendra Modi himself calling the shots, through the president and governor, but the situation there continues to be even worse than it was when the BJP helped run the state government along with the People’s Democratic Party from 2015 to 2018.

>Make no mistake about this – what Amit Shah and Narendra Modi have unveiled on Monday is not just an assault on the unique place that Jammu and Kashmir enjoys in India but on the very federal structure of the Indian constitution. If they spent their first term in office undermining a whole host of institutions, Modi 2.0 will target the one institution that was still somewhat intact – federalism.

Writing in the [Indian Express |  We are just at the beginning](https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/columns/article-370-kashmir-special-status-amit-shah-narendra-modi-govt-5880796/) Imad Ul Riyaz says

>My appreciation for India, and that of many other Kashmiris, and the desire to stand by it in the face of hostility and bullying back home, was sustained by the Constitution. Today, we are dejected, appalled and feel betrayed. The issue is not just about the abrogation of Article 370 — it is about the unconstitutional manner in which the exercise is being carried out, the way national and international treaties have been violated. Most importantly, it is about the manner in which the views of the people of Jammu and Kashmir were ignored.

Writing in the [Washington Post | Modi’s Kashmir gamble may be good politics, but peace should be the ultimate goal](https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2019/08/05/modis-kashmir-gamble-may-be-good-politics-peace-should-be-ultimate-goal/) Barkha Dutt says

>Yet this serious gamble for the future of Kashmir — which could either be a game-changer or set back peace-building efforts by several years — plays politically well for Modi and his home minister and second-in-command, Amit Shah. For one, it pleases Modi’s core base and delivers on an old promise (the ruling BJP’s manifesto had always promised to implement this). Also, with the exception of only a handful, most political parties have backed the government for what it has called the “integration of Kashmir into the mainstream.“

>The Modi government has scored a political victory. But will it alter the course of the 29-year-old insurgency in the Kashmir valley? One of the most worrisome aspects of the last few hours has been how the government has treated mainstream Kashmiri politicians as if they were anti-national separatists. Many of them braved great dangers and faced great pressure to contest elections and maintain allegiance to the Indian state. Weakening them further — one leader told me the latest move “reduces them to zero” — raises questions about who the government opens a dialogue process with should the time come.

WhiteHatJr ORM team gave me death threats on Telegram on Thursday 12th Nov night. I got a DM on telegram giving me threats saying ""***You have no idea what's to come in future when we just move one step forward,... sleep well for today..... we know your location... we won't come for you directly.. but if we want we can come for you tomorrow***"". Although they kept deleting the messages as soon as they were sending, here are the parts of which I was able to take screenshots of.

At this point, the media was acting as if they cant listen to me, they started ignoring my DMs. And this was happening for 15 days already. Things felt really eerie from my end. Almost all the journalists were ignoring this issue. And trust me when I say every publication knows what's going on. I made sure to inform a lot of them. Even got to talk to many of them and in most of the cases, the story got canned by the editor. Byjus is sending them a lot of incentives to not publish about them. One journalist from a reputable publication (which runs of subscriptions and not ads) himself told me that Byjus approached them also and it was shocking for him. And when I asked what happened after that, he also stopped replying. And he knew I was getting such threats shown about for quite some time.

Please don't tell me this and that journalist to contact now, they know and they are ignoring. And the one I talked about above is someone most of you trust, which many of you have suggested me to contact, and some of you also pay for their subscription.

So that night was tough, I had to do something on my own. WhiteHatJr had crossed all the lines already so I also decided to get into the grey zone. The next day I posted videos of their slack channel and started tweeting about them. I have so much against this scam that they can be shut down multiple times now. YET, hardly any journalists have contacted me in the last 5 days. Two journalists did but what's the point if their editors would eventually scrap the articles.

If you want to help, PLEASE DO NOT SUGGEST ME TO CONTACT ANY JOURNALIST, BUT YOU CONTACT THEM, TAG THEM HERE OR TWITTER. But please don't suggest the obvious things. Time constraint is really a bottleneck for me, I have to handle many platforms alone.

I am going through a lot. Wanted to come here and rant but when i see good post, i just think, maybe post it next day.

So I first saw this boy (around 8 years old ) at a bus stand and there was something in him which i cant shake off. The way he stands, the way he looks. Dressed poorly, didn't eat for a long time, selling fruits/flowers roadside from morning to night. 
I wanted to talk to him but he didn't first few days. I used to buy things from him just because i wanted to help him.

 Finally couple of weeks later, he started talking and i  cried that whole day. His parent died when he was too young to talk. Was living with some relatives who were real bad with him. He used to do all home chores but when he said he want to go to school, they took him to another cities bus stand and left.

Its been 6 months, I've been helping him in all the possible ways with study material, food and neccesory cloths. He dont want to go to any anathalay as well. 

There is a couple in mid 50s I know very well and when i talked about him, they said they are willing to adapt him but this boy dont want to become any ones responsibility.

Finally, he agreed on one condition that i visit him every week and the couple do not have to worry about this expenses. I know this couple from some time and i know he will get the best care.

All my rants about life just vanished. Problems are still there. I earn very less but will continue to provide him monetary and other necessities every month. It gives a great feeling which you just can not describe in words.

Just some background info: I freelance part-time and manage about Rs 5-6k a month. Most of my transactions are done through Gpay or PayPal for international. Both are, as of now, connected to my older brother's account. I plan on getting a separate regular savings Corporation account- as it's easier for my parents to send money if needed, and another one for freelance. I plan on using only the latter as much as possible for daily expenses.

I've been mostly looking at zero balance accounts like HDFC, Axis and Kotak 811. Did not see much difference between the first two, but have come across TERRIBLE reviews for Kotak 811. IDFC has the highest interest rates, but I assume the return will be quite negligible for any amount below a lakh or so. These zero balance accounts seem to have a maximum monthly withdrawal/deposit limit of 10k, and a max amount of 50k in the account.

Are there any more of these limitations I should be aware of? Also, are there any other banks you would suggest?","HDFC has high minimum balance requirement?? I am not aware of zero balance account in HDFC.

2293,How People Come To Accept Violence Against Animals As Normal in Mumbai,k40l5z,india,53,False,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/k40l5z/how_people_come_to_accept_violence_against/,24,AskIndia,"I live in Mumbai, and the condition of stray cats and dogs is horrible. people here consider them parasites. 

a few weeks ago I saw a stray cat whose head was half-open, filled with maggots. he was laying under the shadow of a tree, I called every single vet I could find on google, they all declined for help. The one genuinely lovely guy gave me the number of a few NGOs. Almost all of them didn't pick up or were closed. at last, someone agreed to help the cat, he was taken and then admitted.

In my neighborhood, it's normal for kids to kick, beat up cats, throw stones at dogs. they are repulsed by the thought of an animal living in the locality. I've seen people throw hot water at them, kids stepping on their tale and beating them with a stick. I try my best to stop them. the tragedy is, as much I tell them to be nice to them, it makes it even worse. Their family complains about it to mine, then my family tells me if I like them so much, maybe I should invite them to my bed and take a nap with them. The irony is these people are the most religious people I know of.

I would be lying if I said, I didn't want to beat up those kids, but I can empathize with what it's like to feel pain, unlike them. 

at this point I'm helpless, there's no one I know who shares the same affection for the animals as I do

You guys have any tips or suggestions then tell me. (I'm planning on moving as soon as I can)","i really find these type of posts to be hilarious. 

bruv, you wanna see violence against animals, try visiting some animal farms on the outskirts of any major city or visit your local butcher and see the condition of the chicken and the cages they're kept in. try looking at the way sheeps and goats are raised or better yet, search for a thing called veal. 

while i do understand your concern and share your pain as someone who raised few pets, the cats and dogs in cities have it much better than pigs on a farm factory. ",2020-12-01 01:35:09

Everyone fast forward 20 days from my last post. So, TLDR of the last post is that I got hired by a company and they just provided me with a Letter of Intent which is in the post down below:

**Post:** [**https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/itpwph/company\_hire\_me\_on\_loiletter\_of\_intent\_force\_me/**](https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/itpwph/company_hire_me_on_loiletter_of_intent_force_me/)

I started my work on the 27th of August till 17th Sep the day my manager told me to file a resign or she will terminate me, I asked for my compensation as per my LOI and my manager and associate sales director denied that because in these 20 days I failed to bring in the sale they'll not going to pay me anything. This is the first time I heard these criteria from their mouth. I literally worked up 12 hours daily but I got leads which are close to junk. They also shoot a PIP after a week of my work.

As per LOI, I have a fixed wage of 20000 and I mailed the HR  that I'm accepting the informal resignation request and please clear my dues with the company.

**HR Replied:**

>I'm sorry to hear about your resignation. There are no such exit policies. About your working days' salary, then it will be paid in the first week of October,2020. And if there are any expenses incurred because of us, then you can send a mail for reimbursement attaching the proof/invoice of expense.  
>  
>As you have only worked for 20 days, we can't issue an Experience letter to you. I hope I have answered all of your queries. If you have any other queries, please revert back to me. I would be happy to assist you.

&#x200B;

As you could see HR clearly said it that my salary will be paid in a mail.

Now, October 1st week gone and It's 11th of October my salary isn't credited in my account yet.

So, I again send them the email about this

**Mail to Company's HR**

>As you stated in the mail above, I suppose to get my 20 days working salary in the first week of the month of October 2020.  It's been 3 days past the week and my salary is still not credited in my account. Kindly look forward into this matter and credit my dues as soon as possible. Also, I attach my account details below for your reference

In the Reply, the HR tagged that Associate Sales Director said,"" Look into this Matter ""

then that associate sales director replied me this,

**Sales Director reply:**

>We have notified in writing that daily trial targets are 10 per day. you constantly failed to achieve input targets. In terms of revenue contributed 0 revenue. Hence failed on the output front as well.   
>  
>In this pandemic as candidates are working from home and we don't have any other way to make out if they are actually working or not.   
>  
>Given your input parameters are poor we deduce a lack of dedication from your end.  
>  
>Attendance is marked according to input parameters and you are absent for all these days.   
>  
>We lost hope and asked you to look for better opportunities elsewhere.   
>  
>Thank you.

&#x200B;

Now, The crux of this post is that **yes, they give us a Whatsapp message regarding this that 1 sale per day or 8 trail per day or else you are eligible for Loss of Pay** **that day** but I did not acknowledge it, nor they officially emailed about it, they just sneak a message in WhatsApp group about this as It isn't in my LOI and fixed salary is not supposed to based on variable factors. They just sneak that message in team chat once and never mention anything about it until now, nor they said that I was marked absent for all these days based on my performance. I mean shouldn't be they clear about that officially?

So, what should I reply? Should I give up on this? Actually, its 13000INR, If we calculate on the basis of the number of days I worked from them. Although it's still an amount and I feel cheated, I don't want these kinds of false hiring practices would be done by any company be it small or big. I'm not a fresher thus I know that this is totally wrong.

 Also, HR told me that they'll give me my salary then why they are doing this now? Please need some advice and suggestion.",You definitely have a valid case. a whatsapp msg is not a contract. as your salary is less than 25 k  you can file a complaint in the local labour office. ,2020-10-11 17:12:57

I want to buy her a very special Christmas present this year: she is a child at heart who loves plush toys, and she has a special connection with a specific one, the [""Sushi Kitten Plush Toy""](https://www.minisoindia.com/product/sushi-kitten-plush-toys/) from the store Miniso (which doesn't exist in her state, Meghalaya). She always talks about it -- I think because the toy matches her energy (and even kind of looks like her) so this year I want to surprise her with it.

But tragically I can't find it anywhere!!! I have looked on every webshop and contacted every single physical Miniso store in India whose phone number or facebook page I can find. They either don't have it in stock or won't deliver it.

So my last desparate attempt is to come here and make this strange request: **Is there an Indian redditor here who lives in a location with a Miniso who would help me obtain this toy? If you would contact me and arrange to buy it and mail it to Shillong, Meghalaya, I would pay you** ***several times*** **the cost of the toy plus postage (and would of course be eternally grateful)!**

I know it's a long shot but I had to come and post this here since I am out of ideas.

Thank you if you read this!

Edit: I came back after a few hours of being busy to so many responses, so many kind people wanting to help, I have replied to everyone and the item is still yet to be located -- I am hoping that some kind soul manages to track it down once stores open tomorrow, although most locations seem to be out of stock of this rarity!","There is a Miniso store near my area.

Just think of the time when Game of Thrones was being shot around the world, they chose India to supply them with costumes and tents. That’s the kind of art and authenticity this country provides when it comes to apparel. So while China beats India in garment production by quite a margin, India has the upper hand in offering variety, uniqueness and quality clothing. Hence, even though there’s a big gap in manufacturing at the moment, it’s not such a crazy idea to think that** [India could replace China](https://isourcingindia.com/insights/is-india-replacing-china-in-manufacturing-of-electronics/) **in the future as the leading textile industry. India has great potential and thus there is a growth of the Indian Textile Industry.**

## India’s Track Record in Textiles Production

* **India overtook the United States in 2007 to become the** [**second largest cotton producer**](https://www.navyasfashion.com/blog/5-interesting-facts-about-indian-textiles-that-you-need-to-know/) **in the world, after China.

* **In light of the Prime Minister’s ‘Local to Global’ initiative, The Khadi and Village Industries Commission (KVIC) is planning to export its Khadi face masks to foreign countries namely Dubai, USA, Mauritius and several European and Middle East countries where Khadi’s popularity has significantly grown over the last few years.**

## Benefits of Investing in the Indian Textile Industry

## Abundant Raw Material

**Being the largest producer of the cotton, second largest producer of polyester and silk, 3rd largest manufacturer of viscose and 4th largest maker of acrylic and nylon, it’s pretty obvious that there is no shortage of clothing raw material here. On top of that, this overflow of resources greatly helps reduce the overall production cost as well.**

## Unlimited Labour in Indian Textile Industry

**The Textile industry has around 4.5 crore indian garment manufacturers including 35.22 lakh handloom workers across the country. Being a labour intensive industry, it’s pretty neat to have all the workforce you will need for manufacturing your clothing under one roof.**

## Low Production Cost in Indian Textile Industry

**The above mentioned plentitude of labour and raw material is bound to lower your manufacturing cost due to economies of scale and help you reap greater profits from your textile production.**

## Ever Growing Demand in the Indian Market

**And not just the Indian market, who doesn’t want to stay in style and keep up with the ongoing fashion trends? The demand for looking the best will never stop, especially among the second largest population in the world. And if the demand won’t stop, neither will the production.**

## Foreign Garment Companies Flourishing in India

**India allows 100% FDI via the automatic route. Many foreign companies have taken advantage of this and established their brand name in the country over the years. Some of them are:**

1. **Zara**
2. **Levi’s**
3. **Marks and Spencer**
4. **Benetton**
5. **CMT**
6. **Monti**

2342,Hi. I'm taking free programming classes for kids every Sunday.,k025tg,india,49,False,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/k025tg/hi_im_taking_free_programming_classes_for_kids/,12,Business/Finance,"Before you harass me guys, hear me out. I'm teaching Programming via Processing which is a framework specifically meant for artists and kids developed by the folks at the MIT media lab.

Programming is not something kids can become professional at overnight, and start building world class apps in a day. Unlike what most big companies want you to believe. Greatest apps are a result of collaborative effort by multiple employees in companies. Until now, the programmers and the artists were two different professions. However, most of the games and interesting apps, be it Angry Birds, or Flappy Bird, are a mix of creativity and programming.

Hi. I am Harsh, and I am a Research Scholar at the Tata Institute of Fundamental Research, Mumbai. My own journey in programming started almost a decade ago in Undergrad college. In the decade since, the world has changed, our computers have advanced, and programming has changed.In this course, irrespective of your programming background, you can learn how to apply your creativity into code.Having learnt from different places over the years, from University of London, MIT and my own undergrad from DTU, I present this beginner course where boundaries are limitless.

Looking forward to your interests in Creative Programming for Building Visual Applications. We'll build interesting visual web apps that you can interact with, and share with the world over the web.

Checkout the facebook page TortoiseLearningSolutions for contact details, or you can text me here.Through Tortoise Learning Solutions, I'm attempting to take a slow route in this fast moving world where we want children to learn everything instantly.

2345,I went on a date with a girl who thought Modi was an undercover agent for the Congress. She also thought Coronavirus is not as deadly as people making it out to be. What was your weirdest date?,h81n38,india,395,False,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/h81n38/i_went_on_a_date_with_a_girl_who_thought_modi_was/,206,Unverified,"I had built a rapport with this girl I met off Tinder and was sure I'll get laid after the lockdown. 
I met this girl yesterday. I knew she followed conspiracy theories and spiritual pages (1111 angel numbers stuff). Which is cool, I like conspiracies as well. To each their own. But boy, was I in for a ride.
We sat down somewhere outside near a park. She saw a group of guys wearing masks walk past us. She told me, ""look at these people who wear masks. They are in control"". I asked her, ""You don't wear a mask?"". She replies, ""No the government can't control me.""
I asked her, ""how is the government controlling you by making you wear a mask?"" 
-  ""well, if I wear the mask, I can't breath oxygen. My life will be under their control and doing this, makes us paranoid. After a while the goverment will bring out vaccines, this is all a plan by Bill Gates and a group of people to control the world. There is a company, this company is worldwide. They also have it in Bandra. They also own KFC (from here on whenever this company is mentioned they own KFC, there wasn't anything else I know that they own). This company wants to own the world.""
By this point, I wore my mask again as I noticed she wasn't wearing hers. She continued, ""Imagine being SO rich. You will be so bored & you will want to conquer the planet. If Bill Gates comes out with a vaccine, I will never take it, because they want to control us with the vaccine. Do you think it (coronavirus) is that deadly? I have a friend who has done a lot of research about this""
 - ""is he a doctor?"" 
- ""No, he has done a lot of research about this online and he says the Coronavirus is not that deadly. They are lying about the deaths there aren't any or as many deaths"" 

At this point, I had to tell her I wouldn't believe in people who read things of the net and that my ex is a nurse, she has seen people die & that my neighbour who is a doctor tested positive for Coronavirus. I could see here eyes go into a 'error-something-cant-compute'. 
I told her, ""If there is a conspiracy in India, its that cases of people who have the virus and deaths are being underreported."" 
I'm a person who thinks let the other person believe what they want, but if I present some facts, be open to admit that you could be wrong. But, she went on to argue in what she thought is right and that kept on undermining the work of my ex and people worldwide. After a while of arguing, I asked her flat ""Will you be willing to take responsibility that you have killed someone unknowingly?"". I think she thought about this, and her verbal drill stopped for a few seconds, and I could finally breath.
Alas! The topic changed to how this is a plan by the Congress because Modi is their undercover agent. Because, "" imagine they have been in power for 70 years, they know how people think, they won't let the power go from them, they planted Modi in the BJP""
 I said but he's been with the RSS since he was a kid. How does the BJP not figure this out? Why will the Congress kill themselves? Why would the Congress want to be out of power. To which she replied ""WHAT?! Wasn't he a chailwalla dude?""
To be honest, I was riled up by now and kept rebutting with pictures and proofs to prove MODI'S ALLEGIANCE TO THE RSS. OUT OF ALL THE THINGS IN MY LIFE! I NEVER THOUGHT I WOULD HAVE TO PROVE THAT PM MODI IS FROM THE RSS! (I am not a supporter of the BJP or Congress so this made it really weird) 

Anyway, I checked out after this. I was able to make her question her beliefs by now. If you have seen or heard The Joe Rogan Experience,  you'll understand when I say, that I felt I had a date with Eddie Bravo. 
To be fair, she has her own beliefs, but she was a good person with her heart in the right place who has watched a lot of conspiracy theories and met a lot of people who have done their research online.
There went my post lockdown plan as well. 
What was your weirdest date experience?

Edit: I just remembered the other conspiracy theory. She said that Sonia Gandhi is actually a agent of the Rothschild family planted into India.",Going out on dates during this pandemic. You are a fuck wit and is no different than her. ,2020-06-13 13:50:27

Honestly this is a non issue but it just hit a nerve with me.

This is crazy right, but I was booking an Uber today and noticed that my rating had dropped from 5 star to 4.4 star which was surprising. I am always a very courteous person and I don't remember anything happening. My last ride was a routine 15 minute ride from office to home, me and my friend actually waited on the road for the uber driver while we could see him down the road buying gutka. Then nothing happened, we got in, 13 minutes later he dropped us off, I thank him and get off.

The only thing that happened was that me and my friend were talking about the recent slowdown and how little Modi's policies have done to help the situation. The whole time I noticed the drive giving us weird looks in the back mirror but I didn't really think about it much you know.

I don't know why this has pissed me off so much but it has. Uber support is so bad that I cannot even send them a message to clarify what happened. 

Fact is, people like him is why Modi won in a landslide and even when he is failing spectacularly, no one can speak negatively about him. I'm disgusted and absolutely livid.

btw this is my second uber account as my older account was linked to my US phone number and I had to make a new account when I moved to India. On that I had a 4.98 rating with the only negative rating being my birthday night where I was very drunk and don't really remember what happened.","He could have rated you 1 star for other reasons too.

It's okay if a lion eats a deer, or when a male lion kills lion cubs to assert dominance. But when we do the same, it's immoral. What logic is this?  

Ok I was joking, but the reason why it's immoral for us to do the same is because, we can think, and the lion cannot. But that doesn't mean we are not part of nature anymore. Sure we can think, but we have to survive, an a surplus of food is what we need. Stop all the meat production, and the arrest everyone who sells meat.

Get a private security company to check your wife's background.


If you still insist on marriage, get a prenup atleast. Also, make sure you don't let her family move into your home. Whatever you do, don't move to india.

Also make sure there's no ties to right wing or left wing extremst groups by her. I know both types and they got their spouses in foreign countries to escape legal consequences in india. 


Study up some indian culture and history. Be respectful. But not subservient. If the father or brother or whatever male of the family starts testing you, just throw around some big money and wear gaudy jewellery and they will back down. Make sure to mark your territory.

Many of you peeps in this sub are aware of the scumbag practices of Byju's and it's subsidiary Whitehack Jr. Even user u/whitehacksr has posted many posts about it. 

Today i want to let you guys know about this certain small company i went to, last year for ""programming courses"" in Tamil Nadu. 

The founder ""Venkatesan Prabhu"" is apparently a 10 time Microsoft MVP winner. Nothing fishy right?

Now i've heard about this MVP(Most Valued Professional) title but his name doesn't show up in the query in the link(i edited the link a bit because this is a selftext post.)
(https: mvp.microsoft com/en-us/).

He claims to have worked in Microsoft Australia with his wife but i can't check his background. I don't trust his linkedin profile. His entire family runs this show. 

I joined his cramped crowded suffocating office to learn programming languages 2-3 years ago, paid 6k and finished it in a span of 4months. 
The students who join here are from various other southern states and some from northern states some even from abroad(idk how this dude does his advert). 

Search for inplant training and google just plasters his company and his site on the entire first page with a ridiculous amount of mandatory 5 star reviews. Yes they coerce you to type a 5 star review and give a compulsory video review. If you refuse, no certificate for you lol. 

You don't sign on any receipt/application form with any rules. Just pay and take a seat and listen to their real time ""company policy"". 

Not only that your review should contain your real name, which college you're from and what courses you've completed in detail.

Even though there are a handful dozen number of ""staff"" who are assigned to teach you, they're clueless. Doubts.on Machine learning? Virtual function in C++? Entire Java? Well good luck. You'll have to stare at paragraphs of notes on presentation slides in a ""custom buggy application"" typed by the staff referring some old pile of dated materials or from stack exchange. 

The advertised practical learning, learn a language within 30hrs is defenestrated. Did you reach there in time? Well wait for an hour tilk you get drenched in sweat to get a PC. 

They'll nag you constantly to register to their website, subscribe to their YT channels, follow their Insta and FB, fees are not refundable and are to be paid on day one ASAP. 

The constant buzzwords you hear are ""cloud computing, Big Data, A.I"" and what not, only to gain very little knowledge by staring at the materials he created which you could've come across online. 

Finished learning programming languages? Now copy paste templates and codes to create a working DBMS server and a login page or create a website. How are materials OP? They teach you the ABCs and not the grammar(if you catch my drift) and even the materials have mistakes. 

Are you tryna bust your ass into IT companies like infosys? Zoho? TCS? You know all those sweatshops. Well here are these question and answers they'll ask you in your interviews, eat em and puke em. 

Venkat has various dubious claims and one of them is that he had hacked Anna University servers and changed the marks for his friends to get outstanding marks back in his day. 

He has this advice ""to not teach or share whatever you're learning here to your friends, they'll stomp you and never look back"" the rest of the alarmist speech you can figure it out. 

Now for those who don't get a job, in his words ""Come and work here, why should you waste your time when you can be valuable here. I'll give you reasonable pay."" If this doesn't stink more than a skunk's fart then idk what else. The staff members working there are the victims of those words. 

Majority of the students who join here don't do a background check. Words like ""Microsoft MVP"", ""Award winner"", ""World record setter"" are enough to change this office into a honeypot. Oh he's a lawyer now too. 

He even offers internships BUT YOU GOTTA PAY FOR IT lol and that's where most of the crowd comes for, for the internship certificate that they've worked for and paid to a Microsoft MVP who's name doesn't show up in the official website. 

This place is just no more than a massive big ass ponzi scheme factory and his staff members just follow him like a cult. His R&D room is literally a kitchen. 

I was forced to give a 5 star review after my course got over but immediately changed it when i got out of the office. It got deleted the day later.  

Now i got no bad blood with the staff or the head. The staff is friendly but Venkatesan Prabhu is a charismatic douchebag. 

Just wanted to put this here after reading about Byju's and saw similarities with the practices but this one is aimed at engineering college graduates. Private companies and institutions like these should rot in purgatory for exploiting students. 

Kaashiv Infotech has 6,500-ish Google reviews most of em are 5 stars, their in-site review page has 99k reviews all of em 5stars. Of course.

But I would like to point out that it is infact increasing the problem, not solving it.

Even take the case of Radha, she was lover of Krishna, but she is most commonly worshiped as Radhe Maiya.

2401,I want to ask indians about the treatment of women in india and their opinions on it,k1vyr3,india,27,False,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/k1vyr3/i_want_to_ask_indians_about_the_treatment_of/,42,AskIndia,"Edit: this is a migrant Indian Christian problem, not an indian one, thanks for helping me understand, also too many comments, I am going through them all but thank you for being so kind ♡

I was a little afraid to post this because you guys are indians and might take offense to my post but I went ahead to post it because I want to hear your side. I am from singapore, we are developed and women have almost equal rights as men. I say almost because societally and in some rules that still exist, we're not given equal respect or rights but this goes two ways- meaning the same is true for men too. Anyway, I come from a very traditional family who moved from india. And my entire life has been about me being objectified and treated like a property by them in the name of the Indian culture and traditions and threatened with my future/ violence and physically abused if I don't comply.

They are christians and they still believe in dowry and arranged marriage (meaning during a marriage that is arranged by parents of both sides, the girl's family has to ""give"" a huge load of gold to the marriage and say ""hey, this is how much she's worth, take her and this is often a few $10,000"". They want the girl to do ALL the household chores. I remember days when my dad would end work earlier than my mom or be on leave and all he would do is lay on the couch or use his phone/ computer and not help out at all. Like why can't men help out too? No one likes doing it but it needs to be done! On the end, my mother wakes up at 5am daily to cook for the family while my dad gets up much much later. My mom is a community nurse and her job involves visiting patients from home to home and she is tired after work because she is getting old and traveling is tiring. Meanwhile, my dad works in a remote company with a chair to sit all day but he can choose to stand too. Considering all that, my dad does almost nothing at home and my mom exhausts herself 4x more than my dad. She thinks she is doing it for duty and he thinks he doesn't need to help because he is not obliged to.

I couldn't take all that was happening in my house anymore. Everytime I opened my mouth to say anything, my dad and brother would dismiss me and say my opinion is not valid, what they were really saying is I'm a girl and because of that I don't know anything, even though I did much better than my brother in school and I do read a lot and pursue knowledge a lot. Had they listened to me for example, they could have saved $8000 during home renovations. What triggered me to move out of my home was all that and forcing me to study and do things I do not want to and pressuring me to get an arranged marriage. I moved so I can study what I really want- web development and I have an internship now. 

Despite all that, my family still sees me as a failure and a disgrace. They don't care about my academic achievements or career. They even forced me to go to the cheapest university in the country and not let me go to a good university overseas (which i initially wanted). Meanwhile, they are paying as much as university would cost to my brother in polytechnic- it is an alternative path to study before university and an option that I never had. Little do they know, that their ""perfect"" son scammed them of $2000 by printing out a fake form pretending like it was from the school saying he has to go on a compulsory school trip to china for 1 month or he would lose out on credits and it would cost that much. It was a trip with his friends. He also smokes, drinks and does drugs- none of which I judge or condemn but I am mentioning because my parents would flip if they find out I did that. I cut him out of my life after he r*ped his gf (that was the final straw) and has no idea what consent is after he told me how he tried to kiss girls at the bar and they flinched and I told him he cant do that he needs consent and he dismissed me- we argued about it then I realised his view is as distorted and messed up as theirs and I would be better off without him

Today, I work and cook almost everyday- which to me is a huge thing and takes a lot of effort and energy. I know this because I went through a phase of depression where I was unable to do anything but I picked myself up again and I see that as an accomplishment now and progress towards my long term goals. I dont understand how traditional people like my parents and people who don't respect women like my brother can look down on women so much. If my brother was living alone, he would not be able to balance career with housekeeping and cooking as making time for friends (this last one I need to work on more), he would be spending more than me ordering food and not keeping the house tidy. They take us for granted and look down on us when we can do more than them and I dont mean this in a condescending or looking down on only all men way- ofc women like my mom encourage this kind of thinking as well- but rather we have different strengths and it is foolish to look down on women and suppress them when we can do so much. I'm not sure if I made sense here...what are your thoughts on this...what is this worshipping of men and treating women like less than men?","You seem to have a personal issue , traditional views arnt neccasarily like you have mentioned.

For 3 months, I devised a strategy to save this 90% of money, and it involved South Indian restaurants.

For 100 odd days, I used to visit one South Indian restaurant and order 2 idlis, worth Rs 20.

And consumed 5 to 6 cups of sambhar with that..most of the South Indian restaurants give generous amount of refills and that was my savior. I generally used to have that once-in-a day meal at 5 to 6pm, so that I get good sleep.

And it was Sambhar which saved me.

I still remember an aged waiter who filled my refills without even asking. And the happiness which radiated from his face while giving me sambhar was so divine, that it still makes my eyes moist.

>India had informed about Counter Terrorism (CT) action it took yesterday against a training camp of Jaish-e-Mohammed (JeM) in Pakistan based on credible evidence that JeM intended to launch more attacks. Against this Counter Terrorism Action, Pakistan has responded this morning by using its Air Force to target military installations on the Indian side. Due to our high state of readiness and alertness, Pakistan’s attempts were foiled successfully.

>The Pakistan Air Force was detected and the Indian Air Force responded instantly. In that aerial engagement, one Pakistan Air Force fighter aircraft was shot down by a MiG 21 Bison of the Indian Air Force. The Pakistani aircraft was seen by ground forces falling from the sky on the Pakistan side. In this engagement, we have unfortunately lost one MiG 21. The pilot is missing in action. Pakistan has claimed that he is in their custody. We are ascertaining the facts.

Anyone indulging in pure virtue signalling and not treating the various other causes of pollution with importance is a hypocrite. 
In this *rant*, I said nothing to disregard or downplay any other cause for pollution and discourage action against them. Nowhere did I say that we shouldn't do anything about the other things.

But I find folk in this thread consrantly saying 'but what about this ?' 'what about that ?' i.e.indulging in whataboutisms.

Some Notable mentions about Zomato and their (Fraudulent)Scheme

1. Romoving Multiple Gold unlocks at Same table by the group.

2. starting Zomato Crown or something positiong like a premium service and later on closed it.

3. Created a persona during the lockdown that they are helping out the riders and asked up to help pay them ( Mofo are you not already charging high Delivery charges )

4. So they offered Zomato Gold for cheap during lockdown and now they have ended Zomato Gold.


I'll tell you why it hurts me

a. Intially I bought Zomato Gold for 2400 and later in a month they changed the price of gold to directly 1200 and even selling it for 800 at certain locations.

b. They brought in a cap on number of unlocks to only once a table. Which sucked.


b. Cancelled my subscription and bought 2 year subscription for 800Rs. ( Yeeah) 

c. Got the premium delivery services and later on they ended the scheme, now that I had started ordering more at home and office it was good for me and they fucked me over once again.

d. Now they have done Away with the 1+1 and 2+2 on zoamto Gold. Bitch move for me because I go to the restaurant with my girlfriend and she obviously doesn't eat much or drinks more than one.( Win for Me)


People wo go to restaurant with big crowd or family often are the people only who will benefit I guess.

For a couple this scheme is bulshite.

There are hardly any restuarants which are even recognisable for Gold for dine in and delivery as well.

And you can't take your family to such places which are not even known most of these places are just random restuarant in a dark place to reduce rent and Focus on delivering.

I hate this changes which Zomato is doing now and again. just give me what I have paid for I have for Fuck-Sake 4 years of Zoamto Gold you dumb marketing agents.


Additional points:-

1. Delivery food prices are already marked up 25-30% 

2. Now zoamto Pro offer discount of 10%-15% on these.

3. Not to mention the absurd delivery charges from Zomato

4. Unrealistic packing charges by restuarants which they don't charge if you directly order from them but will take ages to reach your place.

5. Same brand QSR( Thebroma , Monginis , ribbons and balloon) having different pricing wtf is this idiotis one outlet has Taxes while the other doesn't how can this be possible. The MRP you are selling at the store or website is already inclusive of that GST.

6. Surcharge for delivery.... No comments on this at all. Even for gold customers

7. One rider being allocated 2 orders at one time when yarr Charing me surcharge for delivery. ( Mai ch*tiya hu Jo jada Paisa de raha hai)

I hate Zomato but I still use it because there is no better or equivalent option available.","Unless they charged you for something and changed policies without refunding that pro-rated amount when you asked for it due to the change, none of these are fraudulent. 

It is a business decision. 15-20% goes into delivery costs by itself for them. They aren't doing charity.

Price difference is not Zomato's call, the restaurant takes that call. I don't know about the present process but other than few key clients, maintaining price parity is an absolute contractual necessity for the restaurants ",2020-08-16 15:37:56

These are my experiences, so far.",guisxu,india,1531,False,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/guisxu/i_travelled_on_domestic_flight_yesterday_these/,219,Unverified,"Hi Everyone. I trust you all are doing well in the lock down (or no lockdown.... whatever) 

I finally swallowed the bitter pill and embarked on domestic air travel yesterday. It is like pulling a wax strip off your body. But I have finally done it. These are my experiences. 

I needed to travel to my in-laws place in Andhra Pradesh, which has been long overdue. Obtained the necessary travel pass from state government web portal, booked tickets. They mentioned on the pass that atleast 7 days of institutional quarantine would be required till I'm tested negative twice, which is cool. 

31/05  15:00pm - Delhi Airport. Disinfectant sprayed on the bags, contact less ID verification at the main entrance. Print the boarding pass from kiosk, check-in baggage and I was good to go. Everything looked so seamless. 

31/05 16:30pm - We got face shield, hand sanitizer sachets and face mask provided by airlines in a simple kit. It was cool again. Things looked sorted, process-wise. They also asked us to fill and submit a basic information form physically along with necessary declarations. I filled it online in Air India website already. Still A ok. 

31/05 17:00pm - Boarding starts. They called seat no. wise. Looked very organised again, avoided crowding at the aircraft entry point. Crew were rocking full PPE. They were absolutely sensitive to passengers agony as everyone was wearing a face shield and a mask on a hot summer afternoon. Water bottles offered with out contact. Take off on time. 

31/05 19.30pm - Landed at Vijayawada. Uncle sitting g next to me was teary eyed, as he has come back to hometown. Tol me he stepped out of his house after 2 months of almost zero human interaction. All happy. 

31/05 20.00pm - Medical Kiosk at the airport. Temperature check, symptoms check, full another form and you are good to go. 

31/05 20.30pm - Police kiosk outside the exit gate. Another time, information was taken along with boarding pass details. The cop told us we are being segregated based on which district we are headed. 4 separate buses waiting outside. They collected a Rs. 150/- ticket to get into the bus, which was strange. I was going to guntur district. 

31/05 21.00pm - Got informed that we are headed towards Guntur primary testing centre, which is 40kms away. Sounded ok. There was one diabetic lady in the bus who was restless already. There were no shops open at the airport. May be it was past closing time. Someone in the bus was kind enough to offer her some biscuits, she calmed down. 

31/05 21.30pm - Policeman gets on the bus, assures us we are in good hands. May be slightly delayed , but pls bear with us. As soon as we a reach, there would be nice dinner and later testing would be done. Once procedure is over, we can head to paid quarantines available in Guntur, they are available at various price points. Everything is taken care of. He also reassured that we may not need 7 days as medical teams are on top of testing in the state. We never saw him again. 

31/05 22.30pm - Bus has not moved. Folks are getting baked inside the hot bus. There is legitimate risk in sitting there for so long. I was wearing a fucking wind cheater which was causing so much perspiration. But hey, we need to take some for the society. We see a new set of policeman and traffic police SUVs for escorting the 4 buses. 

31/05 23.30pm - Bus has not moved yet. Apparently they were waiting for another flight to arrive. People are absolutely hungry and agitated now. 

01/06 12.00am - Bus finally moved. But as passengers familiar with the town noted, we were not heading to Guntur town. 

01/06 01.00am - We finally arrive at a college hostel which is being used as govt quarantine center. There were some people put up there already. There were 2 constables waiting to receive us. And 2 supervisors at the quarantine center. Passengers were agitated. They wanted food. We got down and headed inside expecting dinner. Cops were surprised when we asked for dinner. They said who asks for dinner at 1am!  There are rooms for us there. They were handing out disposable bedsheets. I went in and got my name registered. They gave me a room on 5th floor. This building did not have a lift. Quickly went up and checked. It was a poorly ventilated room with  nothing inside. Hard cement floor and some bedsheets for us to sleep on and common washrooms! 

This was turning into a horror show. There were kids as young as 3 years old to 60 year old. The cops tell us they have no instructions apart from not letting us get away with out testing. Supervisor was already annoyed that he had to stay up late for us. Angry passengers demanding him food - he did not know what to say. 

01/06 1.30am - People already staying there came out of their rooms and told us this is a pathetic place and don't get stuck in this shithole. Loud and clear. They did not care the the cops were standing right there. Most of the people wanted paid quarantine anyway. 
There was one hindi speaking gentleman from Rohini in the group who looked 50+. He was totally confused as he did not understand the language. I was the only one who could converse in his language. He kept checking with me what was happening. I later found out that he was a project director at Amaravati (new state capital) for a large construction company. There was one family Indian-American family with US passports who were probably living their worst nightmare. A couple with 2 little girls who were drained out after crying for so long. 

01/06 2.00am - The entire group got to talking and discussed. We decided that the only solution here is to mobilize some higher authority and convince them to take us to paid quarantines. Just a reminder that these cops had no idea what happens in the airport.  They only met us at quarantine center. 

01/06 2.30am - We convinced the cops to call  their boss and seek help. His boss was not happy when she got the call and had to wake up  at night. She quickly gave a hotel name 'X'. We were supposed to reach there. They took a head count. Oh my god the counting, they would count every fricking 15 mins. That was their only priority - ensure that nobody runs away. Some people in the group told it is one of the reliable hotels in town. It has been there for generations. We got reassured. Looked like the misery is finally over. 

01/06 3.00am - At hotel X. Main entrance - there was only 1 security who had no idea. The place has been shut down since 25th March by police order. Lol. One security and one house keeping/maintenance guy is all they had. It was clear that nothing can materialise there. 

01/06 03.15am - Embarked on wild goose chase in Guntur town, 3 buses ( we were sitting one person every row), 1 police escort vehicle (to ensure nobody runs away) searching for accommodation. Irony is, we were passing by homes of few people sitting inside the bus. It was Pulp Fiction unfolding. 

01/06 03.40am - Reached another hotel. Tough luck. Quest continues. At this point I felt bad for the 2 cops who were bearing the brunt of a bunch of hungry and frustrated group of people and had no solution to offer. 

01/06 4.00am - Another hotel with rooms available. Holy cow, what a delight. 20 people out of the group can be accommodated here. As the hotel guy noted, they were not expecting us. So not every room was ready to be given out and housekeeping staff would only show up in the morning. Old people and families with kids got allotted first. I managed to grab a room for myself. 

01/06 04.30am - Got into my room. It was freaking disgusting. It was not cleaned up after the last guy left. Did some basic cleaning myself. Being a wise guy that I am(yeyy...), carried my own bedsheet, towel toiletries. Settled down but could not sleep as I was feeling hungry and weak. 

01/06 8.00am - I got to have breakfast. Felt like Jon Snow after the Long Night. 

01/06 11.00am - Swab test by medical team who came down to the hotel. 

There may have been lot of things that went wrong in the colossal shit show - lack of co-ordination between district police departments, not enough resources dedicated, may be they don't care or there may be other priority jobs to take care of for the government mechanism. I have no mental energy to think about that. Posting this so that others who are taking up domestic travel are aware of the ground reality. It may be different in each state. 

Finally, my heart goes out to migrant workers who have been enduring even worse nightmares for weeks and months now. If one horrible day can leave scars, imagine what it can do to a person's dignity for extended period of time. 

Hope I don't get into trouble for posting this. I have 2 tracking apps running on my phone - Indian govt app and state govt app.

Hope you are all well.I am having a complusive food disorder.I eat quite less unless the biscuits that are readily available in the market. Sometimes,its really hard to have a healthy quick meals. So ,I decided to have few of them once in weekends.Although they are of high sugar,fat levels and also I am aware that it will negatively impact upon my health in the upcoming days.Still I am crunching up those pieces.Before,this I rarely used to have biscuits not even on weekends.But due to influence of my brother (he used to bought biscuits and keep it on racks) as he used to have them quite daily. So what can I do to solve this issue.Please give me suggestions what to do!!!This largely effect my day to day activity including my finals that are knocking up the door!!!","Do this - 

Keep only healthy snacks at home for a while, like fruits, milk, protein supplements ( if I may ) etc.

Keep diet coke/ zero at home.

Drink coffee instead of eating shit.

Keep food that you can warm up and eat, instead of the stupid biscuits.

Remember this -

Mind is a good servant but a bad master. Do you want it to be a bad master? I guess no.

Try not to give in too easily and soon the cravings will disappear. To not give into your cravings see what makes your biscuits, it's basically flour. Is that what you like ? 

I would additionally recommend researching diet/ nutrition yourself. It will be usefull forever. But please not stupid Instagram posts.

You will be in control before you know it.

These are the tricks I basically use when cutting down. ",2020-09-30 18:53:15

1. The whole argument from their side is BS. 
2. They finally accepted that Wolf Gupta is imaginary. Why didn't they accept this earlier?
3. Check the document, and see for yourself all their hollow claims. The link at the end.
4. I am looking for lawyers. Got a lot of numbers. Talking to them right now. 
5. One good lawyer suggested I back out, sign an apology and end it, said will cost you 30k rupees only, and that's it. 
6. I won't back out. (Although my parents still don't know what mess I have indulged myself into. But I feel I will be able to handle them.)
7. Why did WhiteHatJr take this risky step? Like it seems like it won't go in their favor in public. Yet they took this desperate step. Because they know what I know and they want me to stop sharing it out there in public. Their lawsuit is to get interim junction and make me stop showing it to everyone. And even try to take down all my videos/posts/Reddit everything.
8. In the past 9 days, I tried if some big publication would write about it. But no one did. (Apart from one, Thanks to [Morning Context](https://themorningcontext.com/indias-whitehatjr-is-startup-hell/) and Ashish K Mishra for the article).
9. So what is it that they are trying to bury so hard?
10. This spreadsheet, the LIST of all the videos/tweets/links/posts/LinkedIn/Facebook/IG/ quora/Reddit/(9gag also) they reported and took down. The list contains over 700 such links. (If I included the comments of the parents that they were removing, the list would be over 2k)
11. Here is the List: Download, find these people, and tell them what happened to their posts. If your content was also taken down find it here: 
<As per court orders I have removed the link>

12. There is more. The whole company reeks of lies and deceit. Once I said I will find out who Wolf Gupta and who all these fictitious kids are. Now that the media is silent, here is the birth story of such kids and their 'apps'. And you tell me if I was wrong when I called this company a FRAUD. 

<removed after Delhi HC orders on 24/11/2020 >



Neither the kids existed, nor the apps. And they really created a $300 million company around it.

If that is now fraud what it? Now I think now you can understand why the threats, why this case, why they are talking so much risk but not looking at their own mistakes. This proof was shared with one journalist but they ignored it. Now you can understand why the media was silent.

\--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Now, what do I do here? 

I have three options. 

1. Back out. Apologize and move on. Which I won't.
2. Hire a normal lawyer on my own and they would drag this case and make me exhausted. 
3. As seen in many tweets today, many of you asked me to start a fund and where all can chip in and hire the best lawyer possible. 

Please write in the comments which option should be taken. If option #3, please quote how much can you contribute for real, also suggest to me how to start a fundraiser and what platforms are good for it. WhiteHatJr has already spent 25 lakhs on preparing this case. So legal fights are costly. I alone can only go to a point until my pockets are empty. 

Thanks

Some requests:

1. PLEASE don't suggest me to contact Xyz, it takes time. Each email needs to be written accordingly. I would REALLY appreciate if you write emails to different journalist/YouTubers on my behalf. I am already running out of time. A lot has to be in the next few hours.
2. Some one please cross-post this in different subreddutts.
3. WRITE about this issue. Let's not wait for the media. I have posted most of the proofs on youtube and my Twitter. Please write blogs etc about this. Can someone also try to post this issue on LinkedIn, I am banned from there. 
4. Share etc do all that. You see how to spread this news now. Make a small poster kind of thing, those seem to work better than such long texts. 
5. I might not be able to reply to comments and DMs today, please don't mind.

Thanks again

A quick update since the last post.

* ASCI didn't respond to any of my tweets. The whole [news about ASCI taking down WhiteHatJr](https://www.forbesindia.com/article/special/exclusive-advertising-body-asks-whitehat-jr-to-pull-down-ads/63767/1) was to mellow down resentment against WhiteHatJr and give them a fresh clean slate. Their actions of giving WhiteHatJr an easy escape in case of false advertisement is getting more suspicious. They didn't respond on

1. Why only 5 ads were objected
2. What about the rest 100s of false ads
3. Didn't show the email threads regarding their complaint to WhitehatJr.
4. Didn't tell if they asked who is Wolf Gupta.

ASCI is not a govt body, as it might sound. It's a self-regulation body run by corporates themselves. So kind of their own front to give themselves clean chit when in trouble.

&#x200B;

* A 2 min video of mine asking questions from WHJ teacher finally go viral. Thanks to all the people who contributed to our telegram channel. Got a good SM traction. Things were moving strong on LinkedIn. A LOT of people supported the cause, mostly techies who with a good understanding of coding, who knows the harms of pushing kids in such a rat race.
* Karan Bajaj does a post last evening (4th Nov 2020) around 6pm-ish and calls us a 'Troll' . He wrote ""*A troll works hard too but to tear things down to gain fame, followers, and perhaps fortune. Destroying value and lives in the process.*""
* I didn't respond to his BS. Although at once I got very angry I decided to not play by their rules and keep my focus on more solid proofs. Finally, I didn't comment or anything under his post. For many people who did, their comments got deleted.
* My LinkedIn account gets banned at midnight, around 6 hours after Karan Bajaj calling me a troll.

Now.

1. Karan Calling us a troll: Have you ever seen a CEO acting like this? He also said I am doing this for 'fortune'. So the one who is making $300 million for scamming gullible kids is doubting my intentions. Apart from losing 11 kg in 2.5 months and gaining 27k Karma on Reddit, I am not making a dime here. You guys know my intentions. If anyone still doubts, go to my Reddit posts, scroll down, go to the first posts and see I was posting against Crypto scams as well 3 years back.
2. First, they banned my videos on YT, Quora account, Twitter Id, LinkedIn posts, Panzy Saran tried putting false allegations of harassment on me, and finally, my LinkedIn account goes down. And YET I am a troll and Karan Bajaj is a saint for looting innocent Indian parents.
3. I tried to not make this public because some of my family and friends are also watching this thing getting unfold, I didn't want them to worry. But it's high time I must talk about the msgs I get in DMs.  Ex and current Byjus employees tell me that I must be worried about my physical safety all the time now. A journalist and a good friend told me I am being watched. And even my phone number might be getting tapped. One other journalist told me that I must prepare a dead man switch.

[Such msgs are regular these days. And hence I am living in a safe place alone.](https://preview.redd.it/x4kglhj24fx51.jpg?width=540&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=d21192c868b8637d98a7bdbfda5f00f1adcee2b7)

4.  One of WhiteHatJr employee (the ones who makes fake profiles all the time on Twitter and tries to do fake +ve reinforcement under my tweets) crossed all the limits. He dared to abuse my mother. And I know these scums would be lurking around this post as well, so listen carefully, I will find out who you are and will make you apologize.

[I will SSLY make you apologize.](https://preview.redd.it/4iyl6cuvefx51.jpg?width=375&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=97714a0ab82b1b281d6c8ab1a6c0058aff66c317)

&#x200B;

5. I am still working on the list I talked about last time. I will try to find out every single post/video/tweet/article that was taken down by them and then try to get every single on them reinstated.

6. I have updated most of the journalists in my contact about the potential danger to my life, but seems like it's trivial for them. They are waiting for something to happen. Live Mint recently was doing an article on the WhiteHatJr issue and I was working with one of their good journalist Salman. But in the last hours, the article got canned. This has happened with 4 other publications already in the last 30 days.

&#x200B;

Now this time it's time for YOU to **ACT**. You guys do something, write a post on LinkedIn, ask Karan Bajaj why my ID was banned, why his people are falling down to such low levels and abusing my mother, why isn't he answering any single questions.

The ENTIRE tech community is on our side, how come we don't have a say in how coding must be taught to kids. On one side there is the experience of lakhs of years of coding and engineering and on the other side there are a bunch of greedy VCs who wants to make a circus out of our entire educations system, putting lakhs of kids into the danger of life long depressions, and lakhs of parents into EMI traps.

I have been trying my best on all platforms, from one platform they make me run to another one and then to the third one. It's time to put a stop to this. Even after a couple of good articles from The Ken, Morning Context, Forbes are still daring to call us trolls and putting a ban on us. Let's make an example of this scam so that other 'EdTechs' never forget to stay within ethical limits.

## United we stand, divided we fall

Please ACT. Tweet, Write on LinkedIn, Medium, Quora, FB, IG, Reddit whatever. But in the comments, this time, let's talk about your contribution to this cause.

&#x200B;

Thank you

Pradeep Poonia

2478,"Unless you are really out of options, don't go to Fortis Hospital, even if it's just a routine check-up.",7eh54t,india,599,False,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/7eh54t/unless_you_are_really_out_of_options_dont_go_to/,263,Unverified,"This morning, when I read about [a couple who were charged Rs. 18 lakhs for 15 days of hospitalisation of their daugther](http://www.news18.com/news/india/gurugram-hospital-charges-rs-18-lakh-for-15-day-dengue-treatment-girl-dies-1582807.html), I remembered my own ordeal at Fortis Gurgaon. I am writing this post so that others do not suffer like many have in the past.

Every process in Fortis is designed to break your will and make you subscribe to the treatment prescribed by the doctors.

My wife had been getting treated for an auto-immune condition at Apollo Hospital, Sarita Vihar, Delhi. We were really happy with our doctor and the treatment, but since we had to travel there from Gurgaon every week during the weekdays, we decided to switch to a hospital closer to home. This turned out to be a huge mistake.

Day 1: We called ahead to set up an appointment (which means nothing to them btw). We arrived about half an hour early to get formalities such as patient registration out of the way before our scheduled appointment. It took us an hour and a half of waiting to reach the billing counter. The billing system is designed to make you wait for at least an hour.

Once this was out of the way, we had to wait another half an hour to see the doctor (no biggie). As soon as we stepped into the doctor's cabin, instead of examining my wife or checking her previous reports, the doctor simply suggested some 10-12 tests.  I had to wait for an hour in the billing queue to pay for the damn tests before they would take her blood sample for the tests. After the gruelling wait was over, her blood sample was collected and we left for the day.

Day 2: We went back after 2 days to collect her reports. After that we had to wait for more than an hour to, you got it, pay the bill before we could see the doctor. This time the doc took a cursory glance at the reports before concluding that he required a chest x-ray before we could proceed further. Another hour in the line and an x-ray later, we were told to come back after 2 hours to pick up the report. Fast forward 2 hours, we picked up the report and went to see the doctor. Once again he merely glanced at the x-ray and asked us to get a CT scan done. By this time, my wife had almost had it but I convinced her to go for a CT scan. We wait for about an hour to pay the bill and then 2 hours for our turn for the CT scan. And then head home.

Day 3: We arrive the next day to see the doctor with the CT scan report. This time we are told that there might be something malignant in her lung and that she needs to undergo a biopsy before we can proceed further. By this time I had had it as well. I snapped at the doctor, said no thank you and walked out- never to return. It had become crystal clear what was going on- money was being sucked out of our pockets and we were being inconvenienced at the same time in the most unethical way possible.

We went back to our original doctor and the hospital. The doctor chucked when he saw the reports and simply said they were unnecessary and that there was nothing suspicious in my wife's x-ray or CT scan reports. Thankfully, we got out pretty early. I shudder to think what we might have gone through had we continued the treatment at Fortis.

This ordeal took place a year ago. I did some research on Fortis after that and discovered that it is owned by the same people who used to own Ranbaxy- a pharma company that was often in controversies because of [ineffective, adultered drugs and falsified reports](http://fortune.com/2013/05/15/dirty-medicine/).

My advice to everyone here would be to not visit a Fortis Hospital unless you really have no other options. You would be made to wait for really long hours and would be subject to numerous unnecessary medical tests- all at a premium price tag.

Edit: I had earlier erroneously written MRI instead of CT scan. ","Same holds true for Apollo Hospitals too. They regularly pronounce fake diagnosis and use scare mongering tactics to loot people. They did the same shit with us. My Uncle was diagnosed with a Rib fracture and the family was told that one of the lungs was ruptured and filled with fluid. It was all a ruse to hold the patient in hospital. Even after admitting, they refused to do any tests on the first days and kept giving excuses. After it became clear that they are trying to con us, we wanted to check out, but they refused and said that the patient will not be released for at least a week so that they can make 5-10 lac. It was only after one of my cousins colleagues who had friends in the media threatened to call reporters and expose the hospital that they discharged him. ",2017-11-21 19:19:14

I didn't get time to even listen to music, something I do on a regular basis.

Now I have come to a realisation that this is what my joblife would look like. I think there's something fundamentally broken if ine has to lose all his interests just in order to live.

We have one shot at this life, why is enjoying it looked at as being lazy ? When if one works his ass off even he's still losing so much ?",I know people hate it here but try for a government  job. Salary will be lower but there is good work life balance. Anyhow most people joining nowadays have engineering (after quitting IT jobs) and science background and the environment isn't like the sarkari office of old days. ,2020-11-22 00:16:35

My dog learnt coding from the world number one training institute, ""The Dog Hut"".

I borrowed 50000 from credit card company and enrolled my pet to the coding session. The trainer lady taught coding jargons with lot of passion. She told, many dogs learnt coding and become millionaires by selling their  apps. My dog started salivating, hearing that.

I was not sure, whether it was worth my investment, months passed by, there was no visible change in my pet. I failed to pay credit card EMI, the company sent few goons to threaten me that, If I do not pay up with penalty, they will snatch my pet and sell him to a Chinese. I was cursing my decision to enrol my dog to ""The Dog Hut"".

One fine morning, I got a notification from Google Play to install ""Teach Your Dog How to Bark Properly"" app, I got very angry that someone stole my unicorn Idea, and clicked on the developer information and I got surprise of my life, it was my own dog,  I enquired him about the app, he barked in assertive. The app went viral in social medias. Now, my phone is ringing continuously , I am getting hundreds of calls from Japan, Canada, Australia and USA.

Recently I was thinking and realized that I didn't have a problem with the entirety of Math just the parts that appear abstract because our teachers don't do a good job of explaining it's uses. I discovered that I could learn almost any part of Math as long as it solved a problem I wanted to solve. Geometry, probability and trigonometry (not the equations) were a breeze. I've got a homemade jet engine project in the works and I can learn anything if the project demands it.

Please read.,kdl5hv,india,480,False,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/kdl5hv/right_to_protest_an_important_appeal_please_read/,36,Politics,"A few days ago, when Kangana Ranaut was criticized for accusing Mahinder Kaur, the grandma who was seen marching against farm laws, for being available for protests for ₹100, she quickly retorted that she was merely criticising Bilkis Bano, the woman who was a part of the Anti-CAA protests, and recognized as Time magazine’s list of 100 most influential people.

Ms. Ranaut rants is not worth attention, but we must see the larger agenda of which it is a part of. As you might have observed, in the past few weeks, if you follow popular news and media coverage, a narrative is being pushed to portray the Anti-CAA protesters as villains, rioters, and even terrorists.

One must first try to understand the irony of these claims, where the victims are now being referred to as the perpetrators. The Anti-CAA protests, which happened all across the nation for several months just this year, might still be in the vivid memory of most of the people of India. The protests, which was largely in the form of sit-in dharnas, were one of the most peaceful movements ever organized. These protests against the BJP’s communal and discriminatory citizenship law, was the most patriotic movements in India. It was a movement for the very idea of India, not just a Muslim protest. This you can clearly remember by the slogans, the songs, the emblems, the speeches, and the very characteristic of the movement.

The Anti-CAA protesters braved assault, lathicharge, police brutalities, and even gun firings. Yet, never did the movement became violent. BJP sponsored mobs assaulted students in Jamia and JNU. Throughout the Delhi Assembly election, BJP politicians incited hatred and promoted violence against these protests. And then, Modi’s second pogrom was carried out in Delhi. As vengeful slogans were shouted out against the protest, mobs carried out assault throughout Delhi. Police stood by for first two days, and then helped the BJP mobs. The CCTV cameras were broken. Delhi HC judge, Justice S Murlidhar, who ordered the police to take action, was immediately transferred.

As the pandemic stalled the government, and put a hold on all protests, the government used this moment even more malevolently. While Kapil Mishra, Anurag Thakur, and Parvesh Verma enjoyed impunity, cases were filed against the activists, like Harsh Mander, Umar Khalid, Dr. Kafeel Khan. While overlooking the actual perpetrators, police chargesheet named Yogendra Yadav, Sitaram Yechury, Prof Apporvanand, Prof Jayati Ghosh, among others. Kafeel Khan spent months in jail, Umar Khalid has been charged under the Draconian UAPA law.

But you do remember all this, it was just a few months ago. Why I am reminding you is to try to expose the government’s agenda in its attempt to create different version of history. To manufacture an alternate truth, to change people’s perception. But what’s the larger point behind all this propaganda.

Several weeks ago, Prof Nandini Sunder, professor of Sociology at Delhi School of Economics, wrote an article about how the government is using the same strategy used against Bhima Koregaon protests, against the anti-CAA protests too. Here she lists six clear tactics used by the government.

1. Delegitimize all constitutional protest, as well as efforts to invoke the Constitution.
2. Turn the actual victims of violence into perpetrators and exonerate the real culprits.
3. Take revenge against any marginalized or minority group that dares to assert its rights constitutionally and confronts the RSS attempt to monopolise the country for Hindu upper castes.
4. Break the emerging spirit of solidarity by portraying democratic protests as the assertion of sectional interests.
5. Blaming student groups like the Jamia Co-ordination Committee (JCC), All India Students Association (AISA) or Pinjra Tod for organizing peaceful protests is also a clear attempt to break links between students and society.
6. The criminal cases have the useful effect of embroiling activists in legal battles, taking away scarce resources from all their other work and the questions they are asking of the state.

Read the complete article, [Amit Shah's 'Bhima Koregaon Model' Used For Anti-CAA Protests](https://www.ndtv.com/opinion/amit-shahs-bhim-koregaon-model-used-for-anti-caa-protests-2234716)

Unlike Anti-CAA movement, many of you might not remember the Bhima-Koregaon event, for which dozens of social activists like Sudha Bhardwaj, Anand Teltumbde, Stan Swamy, Varavara Rao, Gautam Navlakha, and many other are languishing in jails. These activists spent their entire life fighting for the cause of the most deprived sections of the society. They have now been made the culprit of a manufactured conspiracy. The police investigation into Bhima-Koregaon is so much frivolous that it could be a script of Ekta Kapoor show.

When the initial investigation was carried out in the Bhima Korgaon case, Sambhaji Bhide and Milind Ekbote were charged and arrested. Soon after an RSS body prepared its own report, blaming the maoists and absolving these two. Police used these reports and other baseless allegations to charge and arrest prominent activists. However, as the BJP lost power in Maharashtra, the NIA took over the case from the state police, without even consulting the Maharashtra home minister.

The activists jailed for these protests are charged not under regular crime laws, but such laws as UAPA, NSA, sedition laws, that even without an iota of evidence, they could be kept in jails for years. You might have read about the SC judgement of Arnab Goswami case to forestall arrest. I agree. It is even our judicial doctrine that bail is the rule and jail is an exception. And before convicting someone, the police must establish the crime. But that everyone is equal before law is even a greater principle.

> ‘Unlawful’ detention: Provisions in the UAPA are stricter than the domestic criminal law. Under the law, the police are allowed a time period of 180 days for investigation as opposed to 60 to 90 days under criminal law. It allows the police to detain an accused for six months at a stretch without producing any evidence against the accused. It also allows the accused to be remanded to police custody for 30 days which is double the amount under criminal law.

> No provision for anticipatory bail: There is no provision for anticipatory bail. Generally, getting bail in UAPA cases is difficult, which is “problematic as it allows for nearly indefinite imprisonment even without conviction, without any concrete proof, only on an indication of a criminal offence on face of it”.

> All these provisions allow for “custodial torture” and other “ill-treatment”, which in India is not an unknown fact. But India still has to ratify the UN Convention Against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment and Punishment.

If you read the article by Prof Sundar, you can understand how the government, its IT Cell, and its propaganda media, is using the same methods of defaming and delegitimising the farmers protests. Calling the farmers, “just Punjab and Haryana”, Khalistanis, Congress sponsored, pampered, communists, urban-naxals, and other names, is not just a gimmick, but a part of a larger plan. It is done to delegitimize all forms of protests in India, to remove “too much democracy” and turn the nation into an autocratic regime.

I am not here to ask you to just be wary of these attempt to malign the democratic movements. I am asking you for help in countering the government's narrative. I am asking you for your voice. We need to defend these movements, not just for their demands and causes, for the people’s fundamental right to protest.

The Bhima-Koregaon movement, the anti-CAA protests, the farmers protests are not individual, isolated, and disconnected protests, but part of a larger democratic movement in India. As the opposition political parties have receded from the discourse, and failed to raise the issues of common people, these movements have become the only way that people can get themselves heard. These movements have increased people’s participation in democracy when government is becoming more centralised and less deliberative. These protests are now challenging the entire politics and the political future of India. I believe in 50 years from now, when history is written about this era, people will scarcely notice that these protests were separated in any way, and will see it as one movement for reclaiming the republic.",Not reading that. But yeah everyone got their right to protest. Everyone has got their own freedom to do whatever the f they want with their life. ,2020-12-15 20:50:26

**[NEW ANNOUNCEMENT FOR THE FIFTH GIVEAWAY HERE!](https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/cb05ss/hello_i_am_giving_away_free_copies_of_brave_new/)**

---

**NEWS:** Whoa! Something just happened! [Both our Giveaways of '1984' and 'Animal Farm' made those book's arrival to the Amazon's 'Most Wished For' list!](https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/a32t7h/rindia_giveaways_bring_1984_and_animal_farm_to/) This is Pretty huge! I mean I've seen 1984 on that list before, in 2014 and in 2016, the years of huge political catastrophes; but I've never seen Animal Farm on that list. Congratulation guys, you all did it! We are going to make another book come on that list very soon! Third Giveaway is on its way! 🎁

**MONEY UPDATE:** [This is how the order page looks](https://i.imgur.com/LWCt2Uv.jpg) 😅  I used my primary Amazon account just for this Giveaway. Each book cost me anywhere between Rs.98 to Rs.120. But for 80% of the orders, I picked the one which is Rs.98, so you can take an average of Rs.110/Book. Some sellers have an order limit, so I pick an edition, and start with each seller one by one, until they give up, then I select another seller, and then another edition. 😊


**FINAL UPDATE**: Thank you everyone! I didn't expect it be this good! When I started this, I had a huge message, but with a not so huge budget in mind, but then I got some help from friends and some of the orders were covered by them! It was really great! I think I managed to cover every request made here, which is pretty cool! So now here's an Announcement for a second Giveaway! 😃

**I am starting a 📖 Giveaway [Part 2] on December 1st! I haven't decided the final book yet, but I do have a few in mind. I would love some suggestions! Don't forget to add this to your Reminders! 🗓**

---

* 📖 Giveaway [Part 1]

I am not sure how to do this, but I guess I can just try!

I think this is a must-read book, especially in these times. When I found that some of my friends have still not read this classic, I gifted them a copy, they loved it! I thought why not do a giveaway here! 

This is high-time, but people are not informed and educated enough to know that this is high-time. They are being misguided, misinformed, and they're not aware how they can fall in this trap. They need to understand the mass psychology of fascism, and how it plays with their mind and their biases and complexes. How media is involved in this. How their prejudices come into play. This book is a good starter. 

Not an instruction manual, this book is a warning! A prophetic masterpiece!

---

If you are interested in reading this, you can first comment here and then DM me, and I will send you a copy right away. I have a limited budget, so I will add the people who came first, and will send out in sequence. 

If you're not comfortable in giving away your addresses, you can give me you Gift Registry link, so I don't have to know your address.

The eBook version is also freely available to read in the Archives [here](https://ia800201.us.archive.org/8/items/NINETEENEIGHTY-FOUR1984ByGeorgeOrwellPDFAudioBook/1984.pdf) and [here](https://ia800109.us.archive.org/34/items/GeorgeOrwell1984_201802/George%20Orwell%20-%201984.pdf)

Thank you! :)

**UPDATE 1: Okay everyone! This got way beyond my budget!  Hell, I increased my budget! It is still OPEN!**

**UPDATE 2: Wow! Awesome responses, thank you! Not just my budget exceeded, even Amazon gave up! I have used all three of my Amazon accounts now. I passed the limit allowable by every seller. Limit is exhausted!**

**UPDATE 3: Okay. More responses coming up! am doing may be a five more.**

**UPDATE 4: My budget is increased, and I am getting help by some angels! I am overwhelmed by the awesome responses! The giveaway is still OPEN! I am using other accounts to send books now! 😊**

Failures in space exploration are disappointing and expensive - but are inevitable (and one could argue essential for eventual success.) 

To space enthusiasts; keep the chins up - the orbiter lives - and will hopefully fulfill its mission objectives in full. 

**Edit II: (8th September)**

The Chandrayaan orbiter has found the exact location of the lander on the lunar surface. 

ISRO confirms that a thermal image of the lander has been taken. The Chandrayaan 2 team will investigate the reasons for the loss of communication with the lander using signal data.

There is no information on the state or condition of the lander yet.

I do not agree with this argument at all. All the nutrition and fitness information you need is available for free online as well. Yet, there are thousands upon thousands of fitness trainers and nutritionists working in every city. From anecdotal experience, I can also say that in many cases the information they provide is actually quite worse than what you could find on your own if you spent some time doing the research. Does that mean that all these people are running a scam? Of course not. There is a lot of value in presenting information in an easily digestible format for the masses. 

I don't see how this has to be any different for programming. Sure, if you are disciplined enough, you can find all the information you want and learn everything on your own, probably much better than anything whitehat jr could teach you. But you are probably a lazy fuck with zero discipline who would watch doraemon in your free time rather than watch youtube tutorials on programming. So, there is still a possibility for a company like that to provide value. Is the value provided by whitehat jr enough for you to justify the price tag. Only YOU get to decide that.

Lately ive been noticing that men (99% of the time Indian) would just profess their love to a woman online. You could see examples of these mainly on YouTube. A comment made by a woman would have atleast one reply from an Indian male asking her to marry him or something along those lines. Why do these men ruin it for every indian out there? Ive had several experiences of my own:

Exhibit A : I commented on youtube under a Shane Dawson video and a few minutes later I get a notification that someone subscribed to my channel. Weird, i thought, I just have one video up, whats there to subscribe to? But i let it go. Another few minutes later, I get notified of a comment on my video (one that I posted) and it said ""i love you ❤❤"" yes,including the hearts. Now the video I posted happened to be one i took at a concert of my fav artist so I thought this guy was just proffessing his love for the above mentioned artist. I commented back ""yeah, me too. I love liam payne"" . The reply to my comment? ""No, i love you"".  This dude doesnt even know my name. 

Exhibit B : I was part of a whattsapp group that shared notes for an exam i was preparing for. One guy had posted a very helpful trick for a certain topic and said that he was willing to share more privately. Obviously, being the idiot i was, I send him a message asking for the notes. To be fair, he did send the notes, excellent ones might i add and I thought that was the end of that. Nope, a month later( the very next day after the exam) he started whattsapp calling me. I didnt pick up cause I dont pick up strange numbers. He sends me a message asking me why i didnt pick up the call.   I thought this was a friend of mine and i said i was busy. Here is how the conversation went

Him : you can never be too busy for your future husband ( A/N : I wish i was making this up)

ME : What the fuck dude? Is this a prank? Do I know you?

Him: I really love you. Please.
Obviously I blocked him but he popped up again with a new number.
 At first I ignored him but then it started getting low-key harrassement. He knew I dont live in India so he started asking me to fly him to my country where we could live happily ever after. At one point I doubted if this was actually a prank, but realised nope dude's just dumb. I straight out told him to stop and leave me the fuck alone.  The guy told me to send nudes which earned him a block and a report.


Has this ever happened to anyone else? I know this harrasment isnt limited to just woman. A guy friend of mine had recieved a text asking him to send a dick pic.",Now you know why women wear burqas and ghungats. ,2020-11-03 18:49:53

I am in my final year of BCA, in this year we have 5 papers, among them we have 1 paper of 100 marks in which we have to submit a project. My professor messaged in our group the deadline for the same but didn't mention any instructions like what stack to use (we have both Java and web programming in our syllabus), the complexity of the project etc and instead wrote to call him for details. When we called, he said that everyone has to give 2000 rupees regardless of whether they submit a project or not.



Now, here's the thing, all of us expected it. Some students are okay with it since they don't want to go through the trouble of making a project. Others are going along with it since it's the safest choice as the professor is the one giving marks, nobody wants to argue with him, he's also the HOD of our department.


Giving 2k isn't a big deal, but it's not abt that, I hate the fact that we have to give money for marks, that the professor is trying to make some quick bucks with this (60 students, each 2k). I can give 2k but I don't want to, I so not want to. It's exactly why most of the students in my class didn't really learned anything cuz they knew they didn't have to, that they'll pass the theory papers somehow and get the project marks by paying money, it's exactly why there are so many bca graduates with no skills. The same thing will happen with my juniors and so on. It kinda is my fault that I didn't go to a better University, or pursue B tech, I had my circumstances. 

So what I want to ask is, what someone in my position should do? Is there anything that I can do? I usually try not to think abt these, I conform to corruption without giving it much thought, I have had to learn to do it over the years. But this issue is frustrating me to no end.

Thank you for ur time. Stay safe!

Update 1: I've asked my friends to record the calls if possible. I obviously wouldn't go to anyone in my college, that'd cause problems for me. Sending an anonymous message to MHRD sounds good. Doing anything right now is risky, I don't want to let anyone know that it was me, waiting until I've graduated seems like the way to go. The deadline is in three weeks, so I'll see how things unfold. Also he's asking to send money through UPI, that's beyond stupid, but understandable since such things are kinda widely accepted here, still I believe he'll relise it and start asking for cash instead. I couldn't care less abt if such people get punished or not, I only want them to stop, they don't seem to be aware of the damage that it's causing. Thank you all for the suggestions. I'll be patient and see how things unfold.",Katega ,2020-11-04 16:10:42

Arushi is the sole occupant of her flat which is on the 4th floor and her only floor neighbour is a drunk, pervert 50 year old, let's call him Manu. The balconies and windows of the two flats are adjacent so whatever is loud enough at Manu's flat, is audible at Arushi's. He likes to sit at his balcony and yell curses about what not and initially, it was just random stuff he's pissed about and his language is the foulest you can imagine, copulating with people's mothers, etc. He tried to initiate conversations multiple times with Arushi but she, of course, avoided him the best she could. She even spoke to Manu personally, very politely about how she finds his language excruciatingly foul and requested him not to do that. Then soon enough, the yelling and cursing quickly descended down to expressing his sexual desires for her in the cheapest ways you can imagine (she even hesitates to describe the exact stuff he says). This will go on for hours on end, every other day. As if this wasn't enough, he will have his merry brand of fellow perverts and get drunk at his flat who all will come and knock at Arushi's door to make things even more difficult for her. Eventually, she went to the police once, they just left the guy with a warning. The events continued, she went to the police the second time, the cops came to the guy's place and left after a bit more serious warning. And then the events continued (the warnings seem to have no effect on him), and one night, when the scenario remained on resume, she had to call the cops and they came and took the drunks away and they were back soon enough again (seemingly, they again, had been just left with some threats and let loose once they were sober). And now they are back at it, yet again. These events span the duration of 3-4 months and obviously, Arushi doesn't feel safe at all having to live in perpetual fear when she has to leave or enter her room having to come across the douchebags, drunk, with their door left wide open. Since the official police warnings have had no effect and even the police doesn't seem to care enough, we are clueless on what to do about this. Woman helplines, reachout centers, the right people to talk to? Any sort of leads or help is appreciated.
Thank you.

Update (after a week since the original post): She got to know Manu had been drunk in his room and dropped to the floor along with his fridge and tomato'd his skull. She lived 4-5 days without knowing there was a dead body the next door. His brother / sister were here to clean up and perform the rituals over the weekend and they apologized to Arushi for what she was put through and commended for having been brave (apparently they knew but didn't / couldn't do anything about it because reasons she didn't want to find out further). Was not expecting that closure. Thank you all for having suggested and helped us.

2619,The army and soldiers shouldn't be glorified,k8z6hl,india,234,False,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/k8z6hl/the_army_and_soldiers_shouldnt_be_glorified/,171,Politics,"&#x200B;

1) From a young age in India, we are taught that soldiers are these infallible deities who are the sole reason we are alive. We are told that being in the armed forces is something which only the 'brave' are capable of and that 'they aren't working for money'. 

Firstly, most soldiers wouldn't 'serve their country' if they didn't get paychecks, societal respect and benefits. We should therefore not treat like they are sacrificing their family and lives for the country; they are sacrificing it for money.

Even if they are these selfless beings who would do this even if they weren't on a payroll, they aren't doing shit for their country. They are just helping the ruling party, not the people. Soldiers do surgical strikes and border attacks before every election so that the ruling party can use that as propaganda. BJP wouldn't have done these surgical strikes if it wouldn't be reported on news. 

Soldiers are used as tools to villify other nations. They are nothing more than political propaganda. Someone like a businessman who generates employment does much more to society and their people than a soldier does. 

&#x200B;

2) When the army is glorified, soldiers are seen as gods of sorts and at that point it is much easier for them to commit war crimes or assault someone. People who have these crimes committed against them will be seen as liars or enemies of soldiers (and thus the country). These people, even if they have evidence will either go unnoticed or unreported.

&#x200B;

Another thing to talk about is how when the army is glorified, more people join the army without knowing what they are getting into. They think it's an incredible job but many don't realize that they literally cant quit for 5+ years or they will be jailed. All the bad things about being a soldier like leaving behind your family or being bind under a contract for years are swept under the rug. This starts from literally kindergarten. Hell, my school teacher FORCED students from my class to join scout programs for army training

&#x200B;

In conclusion, soldiers shouldn't be glorified and people should NOT be encouraged, almost coerced to join the army and soldiers while being a necessity, are not required in such high numbers. Soldiers usually chose this life to escape their poor living conditions (which India knows alot about) and not for serving the country. Soldiers should be treated like any other profession and in India just like everything, soldiers are used as propaganda to divert the nations anger to Pakstan China or somewhere else. Like it always is in India, *Golmaal hai bhai sab golmaal hai*",Both Army and Farmers are glorified way too much in this country. ,2020-12-08 14:31:09

2. IBSPL (the front company for Jio in the auctions) didnt bid for BWA spectrum for mobile operations. Infact, DoT's explicit position was that this spectrum was to be used for broadband and not voice calling. Jio/IBSPL paid Rs 1500 crores for this spectrum, a fraction of price paid by Airtel/Vodafone. 
3. Post Jio buying out IBSPL, they were granted the rights to use this spectrum for cellular services! Neat!
4. Jio's launch of services were predatory in nature. They would have been stopped in any country that respects its law/has a decent anti-competition framework. 
5. Jio offered their services for free as a part of field trials and demanded that their competitors not charge for any calls made by Jio users to their network (IUC charges). TRAI sided with them. Field trials are typically for 90 days. Jio had acquired 100 Million customers through trials which basically lasted months/way longer 
6. Jio didnt make data cheap. They just made it cheap/free long enough for most of the incumbents to bleed out. 

From having a very robust competition (Docomo brought in the pay per second concept, Uninor brought in unlimited usage, Aircel was offering brilliant competition in TN), we now have 3 players and BSNL. 

 Telcos are already at peak capacity in most circles and only VI/BSNL has any room to grow, albeit with very little money. There is no incentive for anyone to better their services since who can you switch to and the way we treated Vodafone, Docomo and Telenor is enough to scare away any new player looking to enter the market.

The pricing is still not sustainable and will have to increase 2x for the telcos to recover their 4g investments before they begin to invest in 5G.",Excellent analysis ,2020-12-04 14:14:38

The patriarchy, misogyny, homophobia, transphobia, casteism, religious barriers, censoring of press, police brutality, marital rape and countless other things just continue to break my heart. In a YT video, I saw a man saying ""I will beat my wife into submission if she doesn't consent"" on the topic of marital rape, he said it openly and brazenly, it shows how much rape culture is a part of Indian society. It makes me sick to my stomach.

I'm leaving this country ASAP. I refuse to live here anymore. I will remember my Indian origin/roots but I'm afraid that I don't love India anymore. It will ALWAYS be this way, it will never change, India will forever be ""developing"" but never develop. I have given up completely.

If you are a Muslim, a woman, a trans person, a gay person, a Dalit or any other oppressed group, I'm so sorry for everything that this country has done to you and will continue to do to you. I hope that you are safe and find something better for yourselves, because you deserve it! Remember, you don't owe anything to a country that ostracizes you!

It's been many years since then, that guy has infact did work hard, he has definitely improved his life a lot. But what bothers me is that he is still motivated by fear than passion. Another guy, who was driven by passion, quit that job built a unicorn 🦄.

Coming back to the discussion, I find it concerning that we think it is a bad thing if others catch up. I wish more people catch up, not just in monetary terms, in everything. But unfortunately what I notice is that as people grow in monetary terms, their curiosity is going in opposite direction.

2. Even though the initial pay in Govt. jobs are high (including perks) the increment is around 3% and an equal years of empolyment in private sector will give me better pay than Govt. job. (8th CPC may fix this?)
3. A Govt. job is very restrictive where in you cannot have any other source of income like blogs, freelance or a side business. You will be doing the same job for almost your entire life and even if you quit from a manager position, it is difficult to transition into the private sector.
4. Govt. jobs are often managerial except in ISRO,DRDO, and the likes and I don't think that I would be a good manager as I am a bit intimidated by responsibilty (for now).
5. Also no matter how much I try I won't get a top notch postion is any org as they are usually held by IAS officers.

If you have quit a private job to get a Sarkaari Naukri as an officer, I would love to get your opinion on the tranistion and seeing your friends in the private sector at a better position than you.","No human with even an ounce of self-respect would work in a government job.

   I am in the works of making an app for Indian Football Scouting. The idea revolves around the fact that there is hardly any or very little quality videos of prospective Indian players for Indian Football Clubs. Let me explain:

1. I would make a portal where one can, Coach / Player / Any interested party can upload small clips of a prospective player.
2. These videos would be uploaded and saved in folders as per the players name and the name of the uploader.
3. I would compile these videos and make a complete video(more than 5 mins) of that player with player analysis.
4. These videos can be downloaded from the portal when an uploader reaches a certain number of uploads or the video can be downloaded for a nominal fee.

What do you think of the idea? Is it good? Is it bad? What else can I do? I really want to help Indian football get better and I hope that this idea can help it get a little better.

Even the D610 (Nikon’s entry level full-frame) or even a DX camera like the D7500 has amazing low-light performance these days, and digital essentially encourages you to take more photos and experiment with settings so you have a better chance of getting that perfect shot.

I am sorry if this post doesn't belong here or If it sounds like a rant but just 2 days back, I just came to know that my cousin's dad was attacked brutally by 2-3 goons in Dwarka at night when he was returning from work on his bicycle. He got off the metro at around 12am at night and was on his way home when he was stopped and beaten mercilessly. The goons didn't rob him and stopped only when they saw a PCR van approaching.

He is in the hospital now and had multiple scans done and is now scheduled for jaw surgery. This is truly heartbreaking for me as their family is really nice. They are a family of three, all of them highly educated, hardworking  and soft spoken people. He returns late from work everyday and rides his bike from the metro station to home even though he has a car just to stay fit while also reduce carbon emissions from his side.

The police doesn't seem to be helping much and are treating it as ""just another everyday case"", like this is normal and expected at Delhi streets. And ofcourse I expect nothing ever to happen to the people who did this, and I am pretty sure they wont get caught.

Just wanted to put this out there, stay safe people and care for your loved ones, you never know what could can happen on the streets of New Delhi.","Lmao. You're delusional and utterly careless if you didn't expect this. One should assume they're always liable to get robbed/mugged/assaulted/raped/kidnapped. You just take precautions and be sensible.

All you're gonna get out of this is an FIR report for your insurance needs, and ammunition in governments arsenal against these goons, lest they commit more serious crimes in future against more significant people.

I don't know. My family situation on fathers side is getting kind of unpleasant  these days.

Grandpa is insecure about his near future. He fears the worst case scenario that non of his sons will take care of him when he and grandmother get bed ridden.

Grandpa fears he will sell his share of the land and blow away the cash.

I have been a proponent of alternative and local food systems throughout my professional career. Also tried my hand at running an urban farming social enterprise in Delhi, but failed at it financially. 

My understanding of the new farm bills is that they take us on the path of the western economies. What happens with increasing corporatisation of agricultural supply chains is well-known and documented throughout most of the western countries:

* Perfect competition amongst the corporates will give way to oligopoly and what is currently a seller (farmer) driven marketplace will convert into a buyer (corporate) driven marketplace. There are only 3-4 big players in the US, for example, who control the entire production of agricultural and dairy commodities. 
* Current supply chains in many western countries are really long and quite a few of them are heavily dependent on food imports. India, on the other hand, has naturally had smaller supply chains and local economies around metro cities. So, food, on an average, travels much less in India as compared to other countries where agriculture has been corporatized. 

I feel that instead of corporatisation of agricultural systems, we need more of the following:

* Farmer-owned co-operatives that can bring the dairy revolution like Amul to the horticulture sector. The southern part of the country has some great examples of coffee and tea production co-operatives that are jointly owned by the employees. 
* Farmers' markets in metro cities which act not only as avenues for farmers to sell their produce but also create awareness about the importance of local food systems.","You are missing one critical point: the trust that the protesting groups have in the ruling party. This is a key point in any protest. If people trust you, they will accept hardships (read DeMo, GST) but once they don't trust you, they won't accept anything that changes the status quo. 

These farm bills are not bad, but farmers consider them as risky. This risk+lack of trust is what is causing the protests, in my humble opinion. ",2020-12-01 13:51:14

Speaking from my opinion, I've seen that almost none of my friends (all aged 16-18) watch or take interest in anime. So is this a specific case with me or the same with majority of the Indian youth? If it is the case with the majority, I would like to know why people neglect anime and take so much interest in bollywood, web series etc? I would like to know what are the reasons that anime is so less popular in India.

Obviously, I'm spreading no hate towards those who prefer bollywood and web series over anime. Everybody has their own preferences, some do like other forms of entertainment over anime. I just want to get an idea of the reasons behind this preference. I want to know what anime lacks when compared to bollywood and web series.

This is my first post here. Recently I came across the concept of round-up savings in the US and UK. So what these apps do is whenever you spend anything, it rounds it up by a set rule and the extra amount goes towards a separate savings/investment account. So this helps you to save while spending and keeps taking small amounts towards saving like children do with their piggy bank. For example, if you order food from Swiggy/Zomato worth 275, it will actually deduct 300 and the extra 25 goes towards your savings. I found it pretty cool.

In 1987, a move by Manu Chhabria to pick up a one per cent stake in Larsen & Toubro (L&T) triggered multiple controversies that ended only 16 years later in 2003, after many riveting political and boardroom dramas. By then, two of the corporate protagonists were dead and employees of the giant engineering conglomerate had taken charge of its destiny

Dubai-based Chhabria had burst on the Indian business scene only two years before with a series of high-profile buys like Shaw Wallace, Dunlop, Hindustan Dorr-Oliver, to name a few. His entry, however, was less than welcome for India's professional managers not least because of his brash management style. So, when Chhabria turned his attentions to the blue-chip L&T, a company that had been established in 1938 by two Danish engineers but lacked identifiable promoters and an attractive target for takeover tycoons, the company's management duly reacted.

Chairman N M Desai asked Reliance Industries (RIL) Chairman, Dhirubhai Ambani to invest in the company's shares as a white knight. Now, Ambani, then well on his way to becoming one of India's most powerful businessmen, rarely let any opportunity pass and he immediately bought 12.4 per cent from the open market. Backed by the Congress Party, Ambani continued to corner more shares from the open market and by 1989 increased his stake to 18.5 per cent by spending close to Rs 190 crore. Remember, all this took place long before the takeover code and market regulator Securities and Exchange Board of India came into play.

But Ambani was no white knight in the conventionally understood sense of the term. Armed with his sizeable stake, he immediately sought, and was granted, board seats for himself and for his sons Mukesh and Anil. It was Desai, the man who had invited Ambani on board, who paid the price for his defensive strategy. He was shunted out as chairman in favour of Dhirubhai.

L&T soon realised that the advent of the Ambanis may have warded off the threat from Chhabria but it was to be no picnic under the Ambani dispensation. L&T was important for Reliance because the company was constructing RIL's petrochemicals complex. But Ambani was also interested in L&T's substantial cash flows.

As chairman of L&T, one of Ambani's first decisions was to ask the company to grant RIL supplier's credit of Rs 570 crore. The cash-rich construction company was also asked to buy RIL shares worth Rs 76 crore from the market from entities close to Reliance. Another controversial decision by Ambani was to make L&T take on more debt.

But the party soon ended for the Ambanis.

In 1989, in a humiliating defeat, the Congress, led by the then Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi, lost power to V P Singh. Soon it became clear that the new Prime Minister Singh was not a friend of the Ambanis or any big business, for that matter; Singh's tenure saw the revival of the raid raj. The government immediately asked state-owned Life Insurance Corporation, the dominant shareholder, to make sure that the Ambanis were out of L&T.

Ambani was forced to resign from the board and former State Bank of India chairman D N Ghosh was asked to replace him. This was also the time when Ambanis were fighting a bitter battle with Nusli Wadia of Bombay Dyeing for supremacy in the petrochemicals business. The Indian Express, led by its feisty Chairman Ramnath Goenka and editor Arun Shourie, wrote a series of exposes about RIL, its controversial takeover of L&T among them.

Meanwhile, under Ghosh, L&T immediately withdrew the supplier's credit to Reliance and started off-loading RIL shares in the market. Though Dhirubhai's sons Mukesh and Anil were still on L&T's board, they soon realised that with a hostile government at the Centre, it was impossible to control the company, since the majority shareholding was still with government-owned institutions.

But luck favoured Ambani. V P Singh's minority government soon collapsed and was replaced in 1990 by Chandra Shekhar, who had closer links to the Ambanis. Ghosh was asked to resign. The Supreme Court also ruled in Ambani's favour. But the economy was also in ruins as a result of a drain on the country's forex reserves. With the general elections of 1991 bringing the Congress back to power in a minority government under PV Narasimha Rao , the Ambanis tried to make a comeback.

In June 1991, the Ambanis had enough shares and proxies to vote Dhirubhai Ambanai back as chairman and Mukesh as the managing director. But following pressure from the Opposition, Prime Minister Rao decided to stay away from the battle. In fact, following orders from the then finance minister Manmohan Singh LIC sought an adjournment of the Extraordinary General Meeting in August 1991 which was to vote on bringing Ambanis back to L&T. Shareholders close to Ambanis, however, refused to vacate the hall.

By then, the Ambanis also realised that it would not be possible for the Congress-led minority to openly support them. Hence, by September they decided to stay away from L&T and dropped resolutions to be installed as chairman and managing director.

After that, the Ambanis stayed on as passive investors in L&T for more than a decade. The calm seemed to have returned on L&T with professionals managing the company. But the Ambanis had one more surprise in store for the company.

In November 2001, the Ambanis abruptly sold their remaining 10.05 per cent stake in L&T to Kumar Mangalam Birla's Grasim. Grasim was directly competing with L&T in the cement business, which is why it wanted to take over the company.

But Birla completely misunderstood one person: A M Naik, the doughty CEO & MD of the company appointed only three year before. Born and educated in a Gujarat village, Naik was not to be cowed down by the corporate raiders. He soon rallied L&T employees behind him and exhorted them to take destiny in their own hands. Instead of remaining servants to others, Naik asked his employees to become owners of the company. ""We should perform so well that it should become impossible for anyone to buy shares in our company because good results will make the stock expensive,"" Naik told them.

Under Naik, L&T finally found its true leader from within. Naik fought Birla's entry into the company tooth and nail and made representations to everyone from the prime minister to LIC to let L&T retain its professional management culture. After months of negotiations, Birla exited L&T by selling its stake to an employees' trust run by L&Ts employees in June 2003. In return, Birlas received L&T's cement division and named it UltraTech. It was a win-win deal for both. The fate of L&T was finally in the hands of its own employees.

From then on, there has been no turning back for L&T and Naik. Since June 2003, the market value of L&T has gone up 25 times, from Rs 6,000 crore to Rs 1,47,000 crore now, with its employees owning 12 per cent of the company. That makes it impossible for anyone to make a hostile raid on it. Naik's dream to make L&T create its own destiny has finally come true. ",2020-12-03 23:05:56

I have undertaken this campaign because I think education is the biggest variable for changing the lives of kids in govt school. In these schools, students lack everything from books to school bags. Further schools in rural areas lack basic educational infrastructure like a desk & chair.  


Most of the students in these schools sit down on the floor for long hours. Sitting on the floor and studying for 6-8 hours affects posture, resulting in back pain, poor eyesight makes it difficult to concentrate and study. I like the ZAB BAG as it solves the problem of a tough durable school bag and doubles as a school desk. The fact that raising 20000 INR or more can give a ZAB BAG (DESK+SCHOOL BAG) and transform the lives of 50 children or more is something that I am very excited about.

I am doing this crowdfunding campaign in partnership with the Wockhardt Foundation. They get the ZAB (DESK+SCHOOL BAG) manufactured through their vendors. Wockhardt Foundation identifies the schools and the students who would require the bag and delivers them to the school, thereby transforming the lives of students in rural areas.

Since Wockhardt Foundation is an NGO, any funding made to this campaign is eligible for tax exemption under 80G of IT Act 1961. In order to enable your 80G receipt to reach you without any hiccups, please ensure that you enter your name and contact information correctly. Foreign funding is also accepted.

Please support my campaign and let us together impact and improve the lives of these fellow students in govt schools in Karnataka. This will over time am sure result in better grades for these students as they will find sitting in a classroom is more enjoyable.

Rant post alert ! Feel free to scroll away 

I loved reading books and guided by this I left my job last year to start an online bookstore based out of Delhi. Initially started as a second hand bookstore, we grew over a period of time and gradually began selling new books too forming partnership with many renowned publishers. We have a small warehouse and I pooled up my savings along with loan from friends and relatives to build it up. 

Covid struck as the perfect catalyst and we are now having a growth rate of 30-50% month on month. Now started the real woes. We required more working capital to sustain our growth and I thought that with so many government schemes and improved ease of doing business in India, we will get an easy loan for the time being. Our thought process was to build up on debt before we dilute our equity for an institutionalised funding. We have our bank account with HDFC since inception and approached them first. And here are our learnings (useful if you want to start your business in future):

1. You need to have banking transactions for at least 3 years before you can apply

2. Since GST is not applicable on books, we don’t have any GST number. That disqualifies us from quite a few schemes. 

3. For applying a credit card from HDFC with whom we have all our banking transactions, they said we need turnover of at least 6-7 crores. Why the hell I would need a credit card if my turnover is that much. 

4. We have secured inventory of more than 20 lakhs and no bank is ready to look into the same and provide us a meagrely amount of even 5 lakhs. 

5. Even for a business with more than 50 lakhs turnover in 6 months, they are asking for a collateral (house, gold or shares) before they can provide us a loan of even 1 lakh. 

6. Everytime you visit the branch, they will simply try upselling personal banking products. They are not at all interested in anything without a collateral. 

7. Today they told us about some shopkeeper loan wherein they can provide us a loan of 5 lakhs at 17% interest. On one hand they give interest on FD at 3-4% and charging such high interest rate on business loans. 

8. One way they told us that we can get an OD was to open a fixed deposit account and get OD limit on our fixed deposit. Why would I deposit my money in bank FD at 3% and get an OD limit of even lesser amount at a higher interest. The employees are not even aware of the common business sense. 

My question is why is it so difficult to get a simple loan when you have sound transactions. How can you expect businesses to crop up and provide employment to our so called youth population (who btw are more interested in getting a cushy government job) when you are not even providing the basic infrastructure ? Does this mean that those who are not from well to do families should accept job as their fate and never even try doing something on their own ? After going through all this, now I have started knowing why people migrate to other countries for a better future. When you know that after all your efforts, the system is designed to fail you, is there even a point to try !

Sorry for the long post. Hopefully I’ll be able to find a workaround but really needed to vent out my frustration.","What I've noticed recently is that there are too many middlemen who will get you a loan for a commission. When you approach a bank through them, your loan will be magically approved even if you have glaring issues. Approach a bank on your own and you'll end up running from pillar to post. Coincidence?

Much of India’s evil radiates from the ways of the Indian village, its traditions, its pettiness, and its “narrow mindedness"", as B.R. Ambedkar put it. As a villager, the farmer is at once a victim and perpetrator. In his role as village patriarch, he is given to playing the curator of caste discrimination, arranging to beat up lovers and denuding and parading women who attempt to elope. Urban India is largely the creation of Indians who fled the miseries of their village. Their urbane scions now, to whom a village is something almost pretty they cross on a highway, have nothing to lose when they say with pious intensity that the Indian farmer is a sacred being. “The hand that feeds us"" has taken the place of the inane urban chant that was vacated by “the spirit of Mumbai"".

Me and my brother were traveling from munsyari to hldwani.  
My brother had to attend his friend's wedding at bhawali, his friend had booked a few rooms at sapphire for the wedding guests. He had had asked us to come to this hotel to freshen up before we come to the wedding. We reached bhawali at around 7 and then proceeded to sapphire inn where other guests were staying. We came down parked our cars and proceeded to freshen up. A lot of guests were coming and going. Around 9pm While I was freshening up my brother went down to receive another of his friend who came in. While my brother was getting him up the owner stopped him and started getting physical with him. During the altercation he stuck my brother's ear ring and it strarted to bleed badly, when I came down towards the reception I saw my brother bleeding and this person getting physical with him, at this point I wasn't aware he was the owner. I held his hands and subdued him so that he stops hitting my brother and he calms down and we can have a discussion about him. This person was heavily drunk and barely able to talk, I thought this was just a visitor who got too drunk and was causing trouble. I asked my brother and his friend to go out and tend to his bleeding ear and told the receptionist to call the police, they had cctvs and we could easily verify what Happened. I went outside and was tending to my brother, waiting for the police to come in, so that I can record my statement and then leave for haldwani , as we wanted to catch the 11pm bus for dehradun for my brother.

Untill then I had no idea that the drunk person was actually the owner of the hotel. Within 5 minutes of the incident around 4 people in different bikes came in, dropped their bikes in front of us, and started beating us with fists and then got some sticks to hit us. The owner and other employees joined in and out numbered us 8 to 2. They hit us on the head multiple times. As the commomtion commenced the other guests who were in the hotel and getting ready saw what's happening downstairs and rescued us from the mob and took us to the base hospital in bhimtal. We had an initial first aid and the he took us to a better hosting in haldwani, where we were tended properly.

I ended up with stitches on my forehead and needing dental and plastic surgery for my face. My brother has multiple stitches on his head.  
We were in the ccu at Krishna hospital haldwani the next day and couldn't go to the police, our parents were in munsyari, who came down the next day to file a report. Before we could file a report the owner filed a report that we had fought amongst ourselves and injured each other. Interestingly they claim the cctvs haven't been working for the last 7 days, which just seems to convenient, as the cctv footage would have been very incriminating for the hotel owners.   
Most of the other people have jobs or are in the army and have declined our pleas to be witnesses in the fir as their parents think it would be problematic which is rather understandable. Disappointing but understandable.

The only two people hurt during the entire process was my brother and me, singled out because we looked different from the group. They never raised a hand on anyone else, and called us bhotias as they were hitting us. I would like to believe this wasn't a racial prejudice based crime but everything that transpired points to that.

We had planned on staying just two hours and ended up being admitted to the hospital. We never checked in to the hotel, hell we weren't even the ones who were involved in any wedding celebration at the hotel or the wedding venue. We were just two people stopping by to give our congratulations to the family. Just because we looked different they decided we could be made the scapegoats for their drunk anger

If anyone reading this think they can help me get some Justice please reach out to me, I will forever be grateful","I believe OP. But anyway, for the sake of fairness, here is the response from the owner on OP's FB post

>This post is half truth my friends. Now that you've listen one side of the story, let me tell you all what exactly happened..Till now we wanted to compromise but now it has gone too far. These two drunk un invited people without any booking broke into our hotel property entered the rooms without permission, further when our receptionist found out such ill-mannered behaviour and tried to stop them he was beaten brutally. In order to save him 50 + middle aged hotel owner came up to handle the situation because these guys did not only beated our employees but also made a problem for the families that were staying. These drunk people then attacked the middle aged owner and fractured his arm. In defense hotel staff supported us.
You all tell me do you find it right, drunken people broking in forcefully without any booking and creating such nuisance.
This publicity stunt done by fake news by these brothers and making negative use of internet is not right. These guys attacked a handicapped person. Where is humanity ?
Our hotel has been respected for 15 years, many celebrities, politicians, families have been attended with all due respect. There has never been such case.
The racism topic they have picked up about being racially discriminated and beaten up for being different is totally fake to attain support and sympathy and trying to save themselves and making up a story...we have family relations and are friends with many people who belong to dharchula and munsyari . My best friend is even from dharchula . These boys are just lying for sympathy and talking all shit.
THESE BROTHERS ARE FAKING UP THE NEWS. PLEASE DON'T SUPPORT THE WRONG PEOPLE. Guys always react when you know both sides story. ",2019-06-13 23:41:13

This is a rant. I know one person who completed PG in medicine in bangalore and he was working in multiple hospitals earning 4L a month just 6 months after MD. Another one completed MD pathology and he gets around 1.5L for his 3 hours in lab. This level of money doesn't exist anywhere in the world for any kind of job. Top level CEOs of small companies might make that much but that too with little to no job security. In India the ratio of salaries of doctors with respect of normal population average salary is more than 10. While nowhere in other countries this ratio is skewed that much. It shows, how our government has created artificial scarcity of doctors and made it more lucrative profession. That is why healthcare is out of reach for many people.","Copy pasting a sub-comment here, because it will be relevant:

OP’s numbers are in the correct ballpark, if not less.

The general physician in my colony charges Rs.500/- per patient in a small dingy shop. He sees 50 patients in the morning and 50 in the evening, 6 days a week. That’s 50000/- per day and >12 lacs per month. Expenses to maintain that dingy shop: barely 1 lac.

Plus he gets referral bonus from testing labs and medicine companies. OP imo is hugely underestimating earnings of doctors. ",2020-10-13 12:31:15
